Think about other issues such as how easy will they be able to keep clean, can they be used in different situations e.g. for school and for playing in the park, are you paying for features you might not need or want e.g. flashing lights or detachable bows?",
  "spend_chapter_3_step_4_idea": "You might want to give each pair of shoes a ranking e.g. 7 out of 10 to help the final decision. The most expensive might not automatically be the best, equally cheapest can sometimes be a false economy if they aren’t as well-made, they may not last as long. Remember sometimes we pay more for a branded product or for product that carries a fashionable logo – this probably won’t make it any better in terms of quality just more desirable.",
  "spend_chapter_4_step_1_idea": "Make a chart to record your ideas. List the things you are going to cut back on – it might help to look in the cupboards and fridge to find the things that have been lurking there for ages … these are things that you don’t use.

Start with just the 1 and 2 pence pieces and then add in the 5p; 10p and 20p.  It will help if you have lots of pennies, so that you can explain that the 2p = 2 x 1p etc.",

You could play a board game such as ‘Pop to the Shops’ or ‘Buy it Right’ which teach about paying and receiving change.
