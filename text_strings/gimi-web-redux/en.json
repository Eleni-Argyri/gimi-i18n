Thus, you should review the Privacy Policy frequently. This Privacy Policy is also part of the Terms that explain your rights and responsibilities when using\nGimi’s services and sites.\n\nPersonal Integrity\nBeing a collaborative community, our top priority will always be our relationship with our community. We are therefore firmly committed to the security and protection of the integrity of our Users of the Service and their contacts.\nThe Gimi Privacy Policy further describes what information you may share with Gimi and other Users and how Gimi may use and share such information.\n\nConsent to Use of Data\nYou agree that Gimi, in accordance with the Gimi Privacy Policy, may collect and use technical data such as your IP address, device ID, usage data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about your mobile device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you related to the Gimi Apps.\n\nInformation Collected and Received\nInstallation and Use\nWhen you install and use the Gimi Apps, Gimi will collect, process and retain personal information from you and any devices you may use in your interaction with our Service.

The information uploaded to the profile section of the Gimi Apps will be received and stored by Gimi until the User changes or deletes such data or terminates the Service. Compulsory information when creating a profile is the User’s phone number, choice of user type (child or adult). Additional information that may be provided at the User’s discretion may include, but is not limited to, photo, gender, street address and post code, country of residence, professional website, Facebook page, Twitter address, Instagram account and a short status message.

Other numbers or information that may be contained in your device’s phonebook will be filtered away and therefore not be stored or used by Gimi. Addresses, passwords and credit card numbers and any other similar information will automatically be prevented from being entered into the Gimi database by our safety algorithms that filter any number and other information stored in the phonebook in a number sequence not compatible with those used for telephone numbers. Please also note that you may always choose not to share Contact Information with Gimi and if you have shared information and changed your mind, you can easily delist your number or opt out to render your entire Contact Information unavailable for search in the database.\n\nOpt-in/registration\nWith the Gimi apps you are provided with a fast and smart signup process for your phone that, among other features, will provide instant search results from your phonebook.

Gimi will always require these parties to take appropriate organisational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation.\n\nThe following is a description of how Gimi may share information about you with trusted third party partners:\nGimi uses a third party partner company in order to send you or a third party you wish to contact SMS messages when you use the Service.

In such cases, your phone number may be part of the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to your device. You may, however, at any time opt out or disable push notifications.\nGimi may allow you to use third party services to create your user profile or log in to use our Service, share information with such third parties, or to connect your user profile with the respective third parties. Those third parties may automatically provide us with access to certain personal information retained by them about you (e.g. content viewed by you, content liked by you and information about the advertisements you have been shown or may have clicked on). You control the personal information you allow us to have access to through the privacy settings on the respective third party service and the permissions you give us when you grant us access to the personal information about you retained by the respective third party service. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Gimi user profile and authorising us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use and retain the information provided by these third party services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. As an example, Gimi may send a queried telephone number to Twitter in order to verify it against the Twitter API or retrieve the holder’s Twitter ID or Twitter photo, if available. If the Twitter ID is available, Gimi will display a Tweet and follow button in the User’s Gimi apps, which the User may use to send an open tweet to, and start to follow, the holder of the number.

You acknowledge and agree that Gimi may transfer your personal data as described above for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. We take all reasonable precaution to protect your information, Contact Information and other Content from misuse, loss and unauthorised access. Although we cannot guarantee this information will not be subject to unauthorised access, Gimi has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect it.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.\nAccuracy of Collected Information\nGimi may on its own initiative, or at your request, replenish, rectify or erase any incomplete, inaccurate or outdated information retained by Gimi in connection with the operation of the Service. You always have the right to know what information is stored about you and have any data corrected or deleted on your request, which should be submitted in accordance with our contact details below.\nThe accuracy and security of information concerning the Users and their contacts are Gimi’s highest priority and they are free to opt in or opt out of the Service at any time.\nIf you use a service, feature, or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Service (including Service we jointly offer with the third party), each party’s terms will govern the respective party’s relationship with you.
