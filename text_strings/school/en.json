  "school_story_end1_subtitle": "Good job! Now you can do the challenge to test what you learned. Remember that you can always redo the story if you dont recall everything.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text1": "Money is really just pieces of paper. It's us humans who have decided what money should be worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text2": "Money is what is called a legal tender.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text3": "In the past, before there even was money, people exchanged things with each other. It was called barter!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text4": "Have you exchanged something with a friend or sibling?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text5": "If you happened to be good at baking, but wanted meat as well, you could exchange your bread for meat with a butcher.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text6": "Isn't that great?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text7": "But you couldn't exchange one loaf of bread for just anything, some things were worth more.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text8": "What do you think is worth the most?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text9": "The right answer is:",
  "school_story_1_screen_text10": "The computer!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text11": "If you wanted to exchange bread for something that was worth more, you would have to agree with the other vendor how many loaves of bread it was worth.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text12": "But how would you calculate it?",
  "school_story_1_screen_text13": "Well, the worth of things is usually determined by how expensive the raw materials or parts of it are.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text14": "To bake bread you need flour, yeast, water and maybe some other things.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text15": "Those are the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text16": "Another example is fabric and thread to sew clothes. The raw materials for clothes are more expensive than the raw materials for bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text17": "But when determining the worth you also have to take into account how hard it is and how long it takes to make.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text18": "In our example, it takes longer time to sew a pair of pants than baking a loaf of bread.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text19": "So if you had bread but wanted to barter for a pair of pants, you would have to exchange a couple of loaves for the other person to be satisfied.",
  "school_story_1_screen_text20": "Today, there are also some other things to take into account when you determine or calculate value. But we will talk about that some other time!",
  "school_story_1_screen_text21": "These were the basics to what money and value are.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text1": "It worked to exchange and barter bread for meat and other goods for a while...",
  "school_story_2_screen_text2": "...but when people started to travel more, it became a hassle to carry around so much bread.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text3": "And some goods like bread or meat go bad and moldy pretty fast.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text4": "That's why people started using legal tender instead!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text5": "Legal tender is what you give a seller instead of exchanging an item.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text6": "If you bought pants for money, you used legal tender!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text7": "In the past they used some weird things before money was invented. It could be stones, sea shells or whale teeth for example.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text8": "Yeah, you're right, whale teeth sounds a bit gross to keep in your pocket. People were probably relieved when they started making legal tender in silver and gold instead.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text9": "Can you guess what that was?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text10": "The answer is coins!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text11": "When the first coins were made, they made them out of silver or gold. You knew how much the coins were worth by weighing them.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text12": "That's where they saying “Worth its weight in gold“ comes from!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text13": "What do you think, doesn't it seem easier to carry a bag of coins than several sacks of bread?",
  "school_story_2_screen_text14": "Coins were used for a long time, we still do! But when people started to own a lot of coins, it got heavy!",
  "school_story_2_screen_text15": "They were also easy to steal. So banks started storing people's coins in exchange for written receipts.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text16": "When you wanted to buy things, you just paid with the receipts. As the receipts became widely used, they decided to make bills. Those are the same bills we use today.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text17": "It might sound a bit funny, but like I said before, it's us people that have decided how much coins and bills should be worth.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text18": "That's why we can pay with bills even though they are really just pieces of paper, which are cheap to make.",
  "school_story_2_screen_text19": "Yes, so, the bills we use to pay for expensive things...",
  "school_story_2_screen_text20": "...are made of the same thing as toilet paper!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text1": "Today it's unusal to pay with coins and bills. But when your parents were your age, they couldn't pay with their phones! They had to pay with cash.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text2": "That's how it was. There were even more coins than today!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text3": "Have you payed with coins or bills in the store?",
  "school_story_3_screen_text4": "Well, today most money is digital. They exist as digits in the bank, you could say. But it's still legal tender.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text5": "Let's pretend you have a 50 piggybucks bill.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text6": "If you deposit it in the bank, they will take your bill. But you will still have 50 piggybucks, just in a digital form.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text7": "If you want to use your digital money to buy something, you use a bank card, like the Gimi card!",
  "school_story_3_screen_text8": "You get the card from Gimi or a bank for example.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text9": "Money just doesn't show up in the bank or your account, someone has to deposit them there first.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text10": "When the money is in the account you can't hold them, but it's really the same thing anyway.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text11": "The amount of money you have in your account is called balance.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text12": "It's a little tricky to keep track of your money when you can't hold them in your hand or keep them in a wallet.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text13": "But you can learn how! One way to do so is to make a budget.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text14": "A budget as you might already know is a structure and plan for how much money you have and how much you spend.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text15": "Expenses are what you pay for or buy. Income is the money that you get or earn.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text16": "We will talk more about what a budget is and how to make one in another chapter.",
  "school_story_3_screen_text17": "The most important part is to remember how much you spend...",
  "school_story_3_screen_text18": "...and calculate how much you have left. Then you can keep track of your money even if it's digital.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text1": "Like I said in the previous chapter, the price of something depends on how expensive its raw materials are and how long it takes to make.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text2": "But it is only one part of the truth.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text3": "Because the price of a product also depends on other things.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text4": "Products, as you may know, is the word for things that you can buy.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text5": "Let’s practice!",
  "school_story_4_screen_text6": "A product is...?",
  "school_story_4_screen_text7": "The right answer is:",
  "school_story_4_screen_text8": "A thing you can buy!",
  "school_story_4_screen_text9": "Except the raw materials and how long it takes to make, it is also something called supply and demand that can affect the price.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text10": "How much there is of something or how easy it is to get is called:",
  "school_story_4_screen_text11": "Supply",
  "school_story_4_screen_text12": "How many that want to buy the product or how much people want it is called:",
  "school_story_4_screen_text13": "Demand",
  "school_story_4_screen_text14": "You will learn more about supply and demand in the next story, but I want to talk more about price and value right now.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text15": "Cost and value are not the same thing even if it seems like it sometimes.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text16": "The cost is what you pay for the product. The price of it.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text17": "The price is often calculated by adding the cost for raw materials and time it takes to make it, and then that is affected by the supply and demand that I talked about.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text18": "But value is a little more complicated.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text19": "Maybe you have heard people say that something was “worth the cost“ or “worth paying for.“",
  "school_story_4_screen_text20": "But what do they actually mean when they say that?",
  "school_story_4_screen_text21": "To understand value better you have to start by learning that there are two kinds of value: subjective value and objective value.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text22": "Wow, those were also difficult words!",
  "school_story_4_screen_text23": "I will explain these words and then you will get to practice in the challenge before I'll continue.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text24": "Something is subjective when you see it from your own point of view. When you have an opinion about it.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text25": "So subjective value is if you think an ice cream is worth 30pb, for example.  You might think that on a warm summer day, but not in the middle of winter.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text26": "Something is objective when you see it from a point of view that is not personal. So it's usually about facts and not about people's opinion and what they think.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text27": "The objective value is often pretty close to the price of a product, otherwise it can be hard to get people to buy it.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text28": "On this planet we will talk about objective value, as it is the one that is important when speaking of cost and pricing.",
  "school_story_4_screen_text29": "Subjective value we will save for later, when we speak about spending and your personal finances.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text1": "Now you will learn more about supply and demand. I know it can be a bit hard, so we will take this whole story for it.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text2": "Let's repeat: demand is how many that want the product or how much they want it...",
  "school_story_5_screen_text3": "...supply is how much there is of something or how easy it is to get.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text4": "If there is a big supply of the product, meaning it's easy to get...",
  "school_story_5_screen_text5": "...then sellers have to lower the price.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text6": "Let me give you an example. In the fall it's apple season because that’s when they get ripe. That means apples are easy to get and many have them in their garden.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text7": "When it's apple season and they are easy to get, the apples are cheaper.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text8": "But in the spring apples are not in season. Sometimes they have to be imported from other countries.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text9": "Then the sellers can make the price higher because people will buy them anyway, and can’t pick them at home.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text10": "With demand it’s the opposite. If many people want something...",
  "school_story_5_screen_text11": "...the sellers can make the price higher.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text12": "But if the demand is low and not that many want to buy the product...",
  "school_story_5_screen_text13": "...they have to lower the price to try and make people buy it.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text14": "An example for demand is when a gaming company is selling a new console. When they release a new one they can set a high price because many people want it.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text15": "But then they also have to lower the price of the old ones because less people want to buy the old models when there is a new one available.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text16": "The summary you should remember is:",
  "school_story_5_screen_text17": "If the supply is high the price is low. \nIf the demand is high the price is high.",
  "school_story_5_screen_text18": "It's even easier to remember it this way:",
  "school_story_5_screen_text19": "If there is a lot of something and enough for everyone it is cheaper. \nIf there is less of something than people that want it, it's more expensive.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text1": "What do things cost? Well, that might sound easy. But it's a hard question to answer.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text2": "That's why I introduced you to value and price in an erlier destination. And supply and demand!",
  "school_story_6_screen_text3": "At this point you probably understand more about WHY things have different prices and that it depends on a lot of things. But now I will try to teach you HOW MUCH things cost.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text4": "I will start by asking you: Do you think it's good to buy something expensive?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text5": "Difficult question! Because something can be expensive because it costs a lot of money, or just more expensive than it usually is.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text6": "If you can afford something that costs a lot, but it is more expensive than it usually is, it's smarter to wait for a better price.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text7": "How do you really know if something is cheap or expensive?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text8": "The easiest answer is that you know it through learning the prices of the things you buy often. Then you know what they usually cost and can compare.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text9": "If you are buying something you don't know the price of, you can go to different stores and compare the price.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text10": "Now a days, with internet you can do it fast!",
  "school_story_6_screen_text11": "When you try to decide if something is cheap or expensive, it's almost always about comparing prices and products.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text12": "You can compare between products that are similar in some way.\nAnd you can compare prices of the same product in different stores.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text13": "To find out if you think a price of a product is reasonable, you can compare it to other products as well.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text14": "Let me give you an example!!",
  "school_story_6_screen_text15": "Pretend that you want to buy french fries at a food stand, but want to compare if the price is fair or not.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text16": "You notice that they also sell pizza and ice cream at the food stand.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text17": "They sell the french fries for 50pb. To compare, you look at the price for pizza and ice cream as well.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text18": "A pizza should be more expensive than french fries. The ice cream should be cheaper. Do you know why?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text19": "Yes, well, the pizza is worth more, because the raw materials are more expensive and it takes more time and effort to make it.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text20": "And the ice cream should be cheaper for the same reason. The ice cream is also a smaller portion of food than the french fries or pizza.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text21": "In this food stand they want 85pb for a pizza.\nThe ice cream is 26pb.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text22": "Are the prices fair when you compare the products?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text23": "Yes they are! The ice cream is the cheapest, the pizza is the most expensive and the french fries are between them in price.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text24": "But then you still don't know so much about if it is cheap or expensive...",
  "school_story_6_screen_text25": "Then, you can also compare prices of the same product in different stores. So you could check in the food stands close what a portion of french fries costs.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text26": "The food stand where you were first, wanted 50pb. In the food stand next to it they want 67pb for french fries. Which stand is the cheapest?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text27": "The food stand closest was the cheapest! But, as you know, sometimes you choose between price and value.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text28": "Because if you know that the more expensive food stand have tastier french fries and larger portions, you might buy the more expensive ones, because then it's worth it!",
  "school_story_6_screen_text29": "I also think it's a bit confusing and messy sometimes, but if you practice in different situations you'll learn!",
  "school_story_7_screen_1_title": "I wondered for a long time what currencies really are.",
  "school_story_7_screen_1_subtitle": "The easiest answer I learned is that it's money!",
  "school_story_7_screen_1_button_1_title": "Why more words?",
  "school_story_7_screen_1_button_2_title": "Okay!",
  "school_story_7_screen_2_title": "You already learned how and why people started using money.",
  "school_story_7_screen_2_subtitle": "When people used coins of gold and silver, they could use them all over the world, as their weight decided their worth.",
  "school_story_7_screen_2_button_1_title": "Yup",
  "school_story_7_screen_2_button_2_title": "I don't remember",
  "school_story_7_screen_3_title": "But when it became common to exchange coins for bills, money started to look different in different countries.",
  "school_story_7_screen_3_subtitle": " It got more complicated.",
  "school_story_7_screen_3_button_1_title": "How so?",
  "school_story_7_screen_4_title": "So to answer our question about what currency is:\nCurrency is a collective word for money.",
  "school_story_7_screen_4_button_1_title": "I knew that!",
  "school_story_7_screen_4_button_2_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_7_screen_5_title": "When talking about different types of money you use the word currency.",
  "school_story_7_screen_5_subtitle": "Most countries have their own currency. ",
  "school_story_7_screen_5_button_1_title": "I have other currencies!",
  "school_story_7_screen_5_button_2_title": "Do they?",
  "school_story_7_screen_6_title": "But there are also larger currencies that are used by more than one country.",
  "school_story_7_screen_6_subtitle": "Dollars and Euros are examples of currencies used by several countries.",
  "school_story_7_screen_6_button_1_title": "I use euros",
  "school_story_7_screen_6_button_2_title": "I use dollars!",
  "school_story_7_screen_6_button_3_title": "🤑",
  "school_story_7_screen_6_button_4_title": "I use Pokédollars",
  "school_story_7_screen_7_title": "Let's go back to the times when bills were still new.",
  "school_story_7_screen_7_subtitle": "To control money and to make sure it could not be faked or forged, the countries started central banks. And they centralized the currency.",
  "school_story_7_screen_7_button_1_title": "Centra... what?",
  "school_story_7_screen_8_title": "This means that some agency in the country, usually the state, took over the control of making the money. So regular banks couldn't decide that anymore.",
  "school_story_7_screen_8_subtitle": "The state decided how much the different bills and coins would be worth and how the money would look. Also how much money to print.",
  "school_story_7_screen_8_button_1_title": "Oh, good",
  "school_story_7_screen_8_button_2_title": "Poor banks",
  "school_story_7_screen_9_title": "They then started places called a mint. The mint was, and still is, the place where the government makes the money.",
  "school_story_7_screen_9_button_1_title": "Funny name",
  "school_story_7_screen_9_button_2_title": "Isn't that candy",
  "school_story_7_screen_9_button_3_title": "I've visited a mint",
  "school_story_7_screen_9_button_4_title": "I want a mint!",
  "school_story_7_screen_11_title": "Through the years the people working at central banks have come up with clever ways of making the bills in a way so it is very hard to forge or fake.",
  "school_story_7_screen_11_button_1_title": "So not like toilet paper anymore",
  "school_story_7_screen_12_title": "Quite a difference between the bills we have today and hand written receipts right?",
  "school_story_7_screen_12_button_1_title": "Absolutely",
  "school_story_7_screen_13_title": "Quick question!",
  "school_story_7_screen_13_subtitle": "What is currency?",
  "school_story_7_screen_13_button_1_title": "Money!",
  "school_story_7_screen_13_button_2_title": "Something happening now",
  "school_story_7_screen_13_button_3_title": "Mint candy",
  "school_story_7_screen_13_button_4_title": "A berry?",
  "school_story_7_screen_14_title": "Sorry I didn't see what you answered! I got distracted by my cat Fido...",
  "school_story_7_screen_14_subtitle": "But the correct answer is: Money!",
  "school_story_7_screen_14_button_1_title": "Isn't Fido a dog's name?",
  "school_story_7_screen_14_button_2_title": "I have a pet too!",
  "school_story_7_screen_14_button_3_title": "I don't have a pet",
  "school_story_7_screen_14_button_4_title": "I have ants in my pants",
  "school_story_7_screen_15_title": "So with all this, it once again became harder to trade and buy things between countries.",
  "school_story_7_screen_15_button_1_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_7_screen_16_title": "A merchant in Germany, for example, could not know if a piece of paper from Sweden was worth anything.",
  "school_story_7_screen_16_subtitle": "Or if it was just paper.",
  "school_story_7_screen_16_button_1_title": "Right, the paper problem again",
  "school_story_7_screen_17_title": "So except making bills that are hard to fake when they centralized the currency,",
  "school_story_7_screen_17_subtitle": "they also had to come up with a system so that people could know what relationship the different currencies had to each other.",
  "school_story_7_screen_17_button_1_title": "Makes sense",
  "school_story_7_screen_17_button_2_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_7_screen_18_title": "If you go to Spain and have 10pb, how much is that in their country? In their currency?",
  "school_story_7_screen_18_subtitle": "To know this you look at the exchange rates of currency.",
  "school_story_7_screen_18_button_1_title": "I get it!",
  "school_story_7_screen_18_button_2_title": "Tell me more?",
  "school_story_7_screen_19_title": "I don't know about you, but this is enough info for me for now.",

  "school_story_8_screen_2_button_1_title": "You taught me what currecy is!",

  "school_story_8_screen_4_button_1_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_8_screen_4_button_2_title": "I know, I have travelled a lot",
  "school_story_8_screen_5_title": "That's how it is, because they use their own money and to be able to buy anything you need to have the same currency.",
  "school_story_8_screen_5_subtitle": "Like I mentioned before, that's called exchanging money. Or more formally: currency exchange.",
  "school_story_8_screen_5_button_1_title": "How does it work?",
  "school_story_8_screen_6_title": "That differs a bit between countries. Some countries have a lot of digital money and some use a lot of cash.",
  "school_story_8_screen_6_subtitle": "So it depends on how it's in the country you travel to.",
  "school_story_8_screen_6_button_1_title": "We pay mostly with cash",
  "school_story_8_screen_6_button_2_title": "Here we mostly use cards",
  "school_story_8_screen_7_title": "If you travel to a country where they don't use cards that much, you bring your own currency with you, to exchange.",
  "school_story_8_screen_7_subtitle": "There are usually special currency exchange shops in those countries.",
  "school_story_8_screen_7_button_1_title": "So weird!",
  "school_story_8_screen_7_button_2_title": "Seems logical",
  "school_story_8_screen_8_title": "You can also exchange the money at home before you go. All countries have places to exchange money. Even yours!",
  "school_story_8_screen_8_subtitle": "Not that long ago this is what you had to do every time you travelled. Cash was king!",
  "school_story_8_screen_8_button_1_title": "I like using foreign currency",
  "school_story_8_screen_8_button_2_title": "I prefer cards",
  "school_story_8_screen_9_title": "It's easier in countries where you pay a lot with your bank or credit card, and cash is not needed as much.",
  "school_story_8_screen_9_subtitle": "Then you don't have to go to a specific place to exchange the money.",
  "school_story_8_screen_9_button_1_title": "I don't?",
  "school_story_8_screen_9_button_2_title": "Okay. Then how?",
  "school_story_8_screen_10_title": "You can use most bank cards all over the world.",
  "school_story_8_screen_10_subtitle": "So you pay directly with your card and your bank makes the currency exchange digitally.",
  "school_story_8_screen_10_button_1_title": "That seems easy...",
  "school_story_8_screen_12_title": "But sometimes you still need cash! Then you can withdraw money from an ATM where ever you're at.",
  "school_story_8_screen_12_subtitle": "Again, same thing if you do it this way. The bank makes the exchange digitally.",
  "school_story_8_screen_12_button_1_title": "Why are you repeating that?",
  "school_story_8_screen_12_button_2_title": "Is that important to know?",
  "school_story_8_screen_13_title": "It is important to understand.",
  "school_story_8_screen_13_subtitle": "Understand what, you probably wonder?",
  "school_story_8_screen_13_button_1_title": "Not really, but tell me",
  "school_story_8_screen_13_button_2_title": "Yes! Just tell me",
  "school_story_8_screen_14_title": "That it is an exchange, however you do it: digitally or manually.",
  "school_story_8_screen_14_subtitle": "You exchange one currency for another. And that's also true when you shop abroad in the store using a card.",
  "school_story_8_screen_14_button_1_title": "Okay, I understand",
  "school_story_8_screen_14_button_2_title": "That's not hard",
  "school_story_8_screen_14_button_3_title": "I still need more info",
  "school_story_8_screen_14_button_4_title": "Is it that simple?",
  "school_story_8_screen_15_title": "But there's a catch!",
  "school_story_8_screen_15_subtitle": "Different currencies are not worth the same.",
  "school_story_8_screen_15_button_1_title": "I remember!",
  "school_story_8_screen_15_button_2_title": "Is it like barter...?",
  "school_story_8_screen_15_button_3_title": "Oh, the value thing",
  "school_story_8_screen_15_button_4_title": "That IS a catch!",
  "school_story_8_screen_16_title": "It is like barter!",
  "school_story_8_screen_16_subtitle": "Do you remember how it worked in barter if you had bread, but wanted to exchange it for pants?",
  "school_story_8_screen_16_button_1_title": "Yes, but I can't explain it",
  "school_story_8_screen_16_button_2_title": "Give them more bread",
  "school_story_8_screen_16_button_3_title": "I don't remember",
  "school_story_8_screen_16_button_4_title": "Pants were worth more than bread?",
  "school_story_8_screen_17_title": "You would give away several loaves of bread because a pair of pants are worth more than a loaf of bread.",
  "school_story_8_screen_17_subtitle": "With currency it works the same way really.",
  "school_story_8_screen_17_button_1_title": "I think I get it",
  "school_story_8_screen_17_button_2_title": "I still don't understand",
  "school_story_8_screen_18_title": "If one currency is worth less than the other, you give more of it than you get back in the exchange.",
  "school_story_8_screen_18_button_1_title": "Okay...?",
  "school_story_8_screen_19_title": "Let's pretend that you want to exchange euro for 1 piggybuck. Piggybucks are worth 2 euros.",
  "school_story_8_screen_19_subtitle": "This is the currency rate. And you would have to give me 2 euros to get 1 piggybuck.",
  "school_story_8_screen_19_button_1_title": "That's not fair!",
  "school_story_8_screen_19_button_2_title": "Why this currency rate?",
  "school_story_8_screen_20_title": "It might seem unfair. But the currency rates are all a bit different and they are decided globally. So all countries agree to them.",
  "school_story_8_screen_20_subtitle": "You can see the currency rate as that currency's price.",
  "school_story_8_screen_20_button_1_title": "How do you know the currency rate?",
  "school_story_8_screen_21_title": "You can check the currency rate for any currency in the world easily online. But make sure you use the right source!",
  "school_story_8_screen_21_subtitle": "Banks are a good source to find out the correct exchange rates.",
  "school_story_8_screen_21_button_1_title": "I will check it out!",
  "school_story_8_screen_21_button_2_title": "Maybe I'll check before I travel",
  "school_story_8_screen_22_title": "Okay, I better go back to unpacking my currencies for my collection!",
  "school_story_8_screen_22_button_1_title": "I'll be back soon!",
  "school_story_9_screen_1_title": "Ready to dive a little deeper into currency, and specifically cryptocurrency?\nCryptocurrencies haven't existed very long.",
  "school_story_9_screen_1_subtitle": "About 20 years ago the first ever cryptocurrency came; Bitcoin.",
  "school_story_9_screen_1_button_1_title": "Wow, they are new!",
  "school_story_9_screen_1_button_2_title": "20 years is a lot!",
  "school_story_9_screen_2_title": "Now there are more of them, like Litecoin or Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies only exist online on screen, in a digital form.",
  "school_story_9_screen_2_subtitle": "But there are also other important differences between these and regular ones.",
  "school_story_9_screen_2_button_1_title": "What differences?",
  "school_story_9_screen_3_title": "The most important difference, is that they are decentralized.",
  "school_story_9_screen_3_subtitle": "Let's do a recap of what we know about the regular currencies.",
  "school_story_9_screen_3_button_1_title": "Please do, I don't remember",
  "school_story_9_screen_3_button_2_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_9_screen_4_title": "Well, remember I told you about how the governments took control over the money?",
  "school_story_9_screen_4_subtitle": "It didn't happen everywhere at the same time, but all regular currencies became centralized. Usually by the state.",
  "school_story_9_screen_4_button_1_title": "Yes, they took control",
  "school_story_9_screen_4_button_2_title": "No...",
  "school_story_9_screen_5_title": "Every centralized currency has a central bank controlling it. For example, the american dollar in USA has the Federal Reserve.",
  "school_story_9_screen_5_subtitle": "The first central bank in the world was and still is in Sweden. It's called Riksbanken and was founded in 1668.",
  "school_story_9_screen_5_button_1_title": "Cool",
  "school_story_9_screen_6_title": "When they took control over it, deciding the value of the money, they centralized the currency.",
  "school_story_9_screen_6_subtitle": "Meaning that the state was now responsible for the value, but also to print the money and decide how much to make.",
  "school_story_9_screen_6_button_1_title": "Hey, why don't they just make a lot?",
  "school_story_9_screen_7_title": "Unfortunately it's not that easy. Supply and demand also applies here actually.",
  "school_story_9_screen_7_subtitle": "If a country just starts to print a lot of money, that will start a process where it will lose it's value.",
  "school_story_9_screen_7_button_1_title": "Wait...",
  "school_story_9_screen_7_button_2_title": "Why supply & demand?",
  "school_story_9_screen_7_button_3_title": "I don't understand",
  "school_story_9_screen_7_button_4_title": "Go on...",
  "school_story_9_screen_8_title": "I know, economical systems are quite complicated, but it's good if we understand the basics. Let's take a simple example.",
  "school_story_9_screen_8_subtitle": "Remember the example of supply and demand and the price of apples?",
  "school_story_9_screen_8_button_1_title": "Yes, but remind me of the details",
  "school_story_9_screen_9_title": "Right, so we were talking about supply, and I told you that when it's apple season, stores can't set high prices on apples.",
  "school_story_9_screen_9_subtitle": "This is because it's so easy for the buyer to get them everywhere, apples loose value.",
  "school_story_9_screen_9_button_1_title": "Yup",
  "school_story_9_screen_11_title": "Now you have part of the picture, and we'll add demand. Remember? Demand is how many people that want a product.",
  "school_story_9_screen_11_subtitle": "And when the demand is high, the price goes up. Now, imagine you have a store selling shoes.",
  "school_story_9_screen_11_button_1_title": "Ooh a sneaker store!",
  "school_story_9_screen_11_button_2_title": "I will sell blue shoes",
  "school_story_9_screen_12_title": "One day you realize that more and more people have bought shoes lately.",
  "school_story_9_screen_12_subtitle": "Also, they buy three pairs at a time! Wouldn't you increase the prices?",
  "school_story_9_screen_12_button_1_title": "Absolutely! I would make more money!",
  "school_story_9_screen_12_button_2_title": "Maybe... should I?",
  "school_story_9_screen_13_title": "Yes, any good buisness man or woman would!",
  "school_story_9_screen_13_subtitle": "Let's put the pieces together now to understand why it's not good to flood the country with money.",
  "school_story_9_screen_13_button_1_title": "Okay, do it!",
  "school_story_9_screen_14_title": "So, the state prints a lot of extra money, which makes it more available and people have more to spend. They start shopping more.",
  "school_story_9_screen_14_subtitle": "Like you in your shoe shop, all vendors and stores raise their prices. Everything gets more expensive. And the money loses value.",
  "school_story_9_screen_14_button_1_title": "Okay, that doesn't sound good",
  "school_story_9_screen_15_title": "No, it's not. And it becomes a bad cycle that the whole country suffers from and it is not an easy situation to fix.",
  "school_story_9_screen_15_subtitle": "It's called hyperinflation.",
  "school_story_9_screen_15_button_1_title": "I‘ve heard that before",
  "school_story_9_screen_15_button_2_title": "I‘ve neverever heard of it",
  "school_story_9_screen_16_title": "Now that you know more about centralized currency and what that means, we can go back to the other type of currency: cryptocurrency.",
  "school_story_9_screen_16_subtitle": "Cryptocurrency is NOT centralized. No state or central bank controls it. And as it only exists digitally no one prints it.",
  "school_story_9_screen_16_button_1_title": "How does it work then?",
  "school_story_9_screen_17_title": "Good question! Actually, it's more alike to the barter system, because its value isn't assured by a central bank.",
  "school_story_9_screen_17_subtitle": "No one guarantees the value of the Bitcoin for example, it's completely based on trust between those who use it.",
  "school_story_9_screen_17_button_1_title": "That seems risky",
  "school_story_9_screen_17_button_2_title": "I use Bitcoin!",
  "school_story_9_screen_17_button_3_title": "I rather have cash",
  "school_story_9_screen_17_button_4_title": "Any money is fine for me!",
  "school_story_9_screen_18_title": "The last big difference is that the money transfers go directly between users.",
  "school_story_9_screen_18_subtitle": "It is a so called peer-to-peer system, with no bank or others being involved.",
  "school_story_9_screen_18_button_1_title": "I like P2P",
  "school_story_9_screen_18_button_2_title": "I don't like P2P",
  "school_story_9_screen_18_button_3_title": "I don't know P2P",
  "school_story_9_screen_18_button_4_title": "I don't care",
  "school_story_9_screen_19_title": "Let's sum it up.\nThere are three major differences between cryptocurrency and regular currency:",
  "school_story_9_screen_19_subtitle": "1. Cryptocurrency only exists digitally.\n2. Regular currency is centralized, cryptocurrency is not.\n3. Cryptocurrency is peer-to-peer and based on trust.",
  "school_story_9_screen_19_button_1_title": "Got it!",
  "school_story_9_screen_19_button_2_title": "I will have to repeat this",
  "school_story_10_screen_1_title": "Phuh! Hi, just give me a second. I just came back from work, and I have to find my glasses to get into my teacher mood!",
  "school_story_10_screen_1_button_1_title": "You have a job?",
  "school_story_10_screen_1_button_2_title": "I thought this was your job!",
  "school_story_10_screen_2_title": "Ha! Yup, I have a job! And helping you learn financial superskills is for fun! And also because I know it is important!",
  "school_story_10_screen_2_subtitle": "This is a perfect introduction actually to the topic of this planet: Earning!",
  "school_story_10_screen_2_button_1_title": "But Piggy, what is your job then?",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_title": "Uuhm... You know, I think I will keep that a secret for now. I don't want you to know everything about me from the start. I'm secretive and mysterious that way...",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_subtitle": "So. Earning. Are you with me?",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_button_1_title": "Yup go!",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_button_2_title": "I guess...",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_button_3_title": "Sure!",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_button_4_title": "You are not mysterious haha!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_title": "Do you know what earning is?",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_subtitle": "Take a guess!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_button_1_title": "You get money from working!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_button_2_title": "Selling something for more money than you payed!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_button_3_title": "Doing chores and getting paid!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_button_4_title": "Getting paid interest from a savings account!",
  "school_story_10_screen_5_title": "Was it hard to choose? I tricked you a bit there, because all those answers were right.",
  "school_story_10_screen_5_subtitle": "They are all ways of earning money!",
  "school_story_10_screen_5_button_1_title": "You tricked me!",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_title": "Yes sorry, but it makes a good point you see? There are many ways of earning money. You probably know that you can earn other things than money.",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_subtitle": "You can earn money, praise, a reward or even earn respect! But we will just talk about earning money.",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_button_1_title": "You have earned my respect!",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_button_2_title": "I think I earned some praise!",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_button_3_title": "Can I earn a reward now?",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_button_4_title": "I want to earn money!",
  "school_story_10_screen_7_title": "Back to the lesson on what earning money really is. To earn, is to get something in return for your work, labour or effort.",
  "school_story_10_screen_7_subtitle": "That's why all those examples in the very beginning were true.",
  "school_story_10_screen_7_button_1_title": "Can you remind me of them?",
  "school_story_10_screen_8_title": "Sure, and I will do more, by explaining why they all the examples are earning money. ",
  "school_story_10_screen_8_subtitle": "You earn a salary when you work, this is probably the clearest and most common example. Same thing with earning money by getting paid for chores.",
  "school_story_10_screen_8_button_1_title": "Yeah, that's like a job for kids!",
  "school_story_10_screen_9_title": "Yes, that's true, it's a very good way to practice and learn that you actually have to earn your money, not just ‘get’ it.",
  "school_story_10_screen_9_subtitle": "When you earn interest from a saving account, you have done the bank a service because you loan them the money for a while. And it's also an effort to save!",
  "school_story_10_screen_9_button_1_title": "Yes it is!",
  "school_story_10_screen_9_button_2_title": "It's clearer now that you explained",
  "school_story_10_screen_11_title": "The last one is the one that can be the hardest to understand at first. It was the alternative ‘Selling something for more money than you payed.’",
  "school_story_10_screen_11_subtitle": "To do that, you have in most cases done something to make it better. That is effort and time you put into it. Or you have put effort into selling it well, in either case you earned the extra money!",
  "school_story_10_screen_11_button_1_title": "I think I got it",
  "school_story_10_screen_11_button_2_title": "Cool, go on",
  "school_story_10_screen_12_title": "I think you understand earning money and what it is a bit better now. And this is a large part of personal finance!",
  "school_story_10_screen_12_subtitle": "The three important things to be good at to handle your money well are; Earning, saving and spending. And earning is really a central part.",
  "school_story_10_screen_12_button_1_title": "Yeah, with no earning there is no saving or spending!",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_title": "Yup, you really hit the head on the nail there! That is also why we start with earning, but being smart with all of them will ensure success.",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_subtitle": "They are all connected as you will see, so clever earning, nifty saving and smart spending is the killer combo.",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_button_1_title": "Think I'm a smart spender",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_button_2_title": "I'm a nifty saver!",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_button_3_title": "I want to practice clever earning",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_button_4_title": "I'm a big spender...",
  "school_story_10_screen_14_title": "The classical way of earning money is through a job. But jobs can be so different!",
  "school_story_10_screen_14_subtitle": "Some jobs are performing a service, like doctors or people doing different repairs. Others work with selling products or manufacturing products.",
  "school_story_10_screen_14_button_1_title": "I already know what job I want!",
  "school_story_10_screen_14_button_2_title": "I have no clue what to work with",
  "school_story_10_screen_15_title": "You of course have time to decide what to do, but anything can be a job if you can earn money from it.",
  "school_story_10_screen_15_subtitle": "So use your imagination and go wild. Maybe you already have an idea for an invention? Being an entrepreneur, you also earn money!",
  "school_story_10_screen_15_button_1_title": "I will think on it",
  "school_story_10_screen_15_button_2_title": "I already know, I'm sure!",
  "school_story_10_screen_16_title": "Whatever you do it's good to start early, with practicing I mean. Doing chores, maybe helping neighbours?",
  "school_story_10_screen_16_subtitle": "I will give you some more tips on starting to earn money as a child, so you don't have to wait until you grow up to be an adult!",
  "school_story_10_screen_16_button_1_title": "Yes! I want to know",
  "school_story_10_screen_16_button_2_title": "Now...?",
  "school_story_10_screen_17_title": "Not now though, in a later destination. I am going to read the paper right now. I saw someone had won the lottery on this planet... ",
  "school_story_10_screen_17_button_1_title": "That would be so great, to win and become a millionaire!",
  "school_story_10_screen_18_title": "It does happen, but  honestly luck is not something you should rely on. Take scratchers for example.",
  "school_story_10_screen_18_subtitle": "Did you know that the chances of winning that much money are so low, that you could buy one every day for the rest of your life, and not win a million?",
  "school_story_10_screen_18_button_1_title": "what? really?",
  "school_story_10_screen_18_button_2_title": "Are you sure...?",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_title": "It's true, it can be calculated with math. And doing that, let's say for 60 years, you would spend a bit over half a million!",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_subtitle": "So, I rather rely on earning. Luck is great, but clever earning is reliable and steady, and if you save smart instead, with interest, you would have a million!",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_button_1_title": "That sounds logical! And smart!",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_button_2_title": "I will have to check that math...",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_button_3_title": "It really sounds unbelievable",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_button_4_title": "Gambling is not good!",
  "school_story_11_screen_1_title": "...we finished the last destination on the fact that the lottery or relying on luck is not a good strategy for earning.",
  "school_story_11_screen_1_subtitle": "But what is then...?",
  "school_story_11_screen_1_button_1_title": "Hard work!",
  "school_story_11_screen_1_button_2_title": "I dont know?",
  "school_story_11_screen_2_title": "You must have heard someone say ‘Money doesn't grow on trees’?",
  "school_story_11_screen_2_button_1_title": "Yup, many times",
  "school_story_11_screen_2_button_2_title": "No...?",
  "school_story_11_screen_2_button_3_title": "I think so",
  "school_story_11_screen_2_button_4_title": "But aren't bills paper...?",
  "school_story_11_screen_3_title": "Yes, well it is true that money bills, toilet paper as well as all paper is made out of wood, and trees really.",
  "school_story_11_screen_3_subtitle": "It's clever if you got that! But that is not what the saying is about. It's about the fact that money is not just there for the picking.",
  "school_story_11_screen_3_button_1_title": "Yeah, of course",
  "school_story_11_screen_3_button_2_title": "It isn't?",
  "school_story_11_screen_4_title": "It's such a common saying, that really means that you actually have to work for money, to earn it.",
  "school_story_11_screen_4_subtitle": "If you recall from before, to save and spend money, you have to earn them first!",
  "school_story_11_screen_4_button_1_title": "Yes, but how...?",
  "school_story_11_screen_5_title": "So you know that the best way is through a job",
  "school_story_11_screen_5_subtitle": "One of the examples I made was working with selling products or manufacturing them.",
  "school_story_11_screen_5_button_1_title": "I remember!",
  "school_story_11_screen_5_button_2_title": "I could work in a store",
  "school_story_11_screen_6_title": "Quick question!",
  "school_story_11_screen_6_subtitle": "Do you know what manufacturing a product is?",
  "school_story_11_screen_6_button_1_title": "To sell it",
  "school_story_11_screen_6_button_2_title": "To build or make it",
  "school_story_11_screen_6_button_3_title": "To destroy it",
  "school_story_11_screen_6_button_4_title": "I don't know",
  "school_story_11_screen_7_title": "The right answer is:",
  "school_story_11_screen_7_subtitle": "To build or make a product. It can also be to assemble a product.",
  "school_story_11_screen_7_button_1_title": "Oh okay!",
  "school_story_11_screen_7_button_2_title": "Yup, knew it",
  "school_story_11_screen_8_title": "Anyways, you of course have time to decide what to do or be when you grow up, but anything can be a job if you can earn money from it.",
  "school_story_11_screen_8_subtitle": "So use your imagination and go wild. Maybe you already have an idea for an invention? Being an entrepreneur, you also earn money!",
  "school_story_11_screen_8_button_1_title": "I will think on it",
  "school_story_11_screen_8_button_2_title": "I already know, I'm sure!",
  "school_story_11_screen_10_title": "Maybe you don't know what an entrepreneur is?",
  "school_story_11_screen_10_subtitle": "It is when you have your own company, being your own boss. Usually when you come up with an idea for a service or an invention.",
  "school_story_11_screen_10_button_1_title": "I want to be that!",
  "school_story_11_screen_10_button_2_title": "I am so a boss!",
  "school_story_11_screen_11_title": "People can also have their own company if they work as a consultant which is when you give advice in your field, or do projects for other companies.",
  "school_story_11_screen_11_subtitle": "but that is most common when you have more experience.",
  "school_story_11_screen_11_button_1_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_11_screen_11_button_2_title": "Do you know how I earn Robux?",
  "school_story_11_screen_11_button_3_title": "I want a regular job",
  "school_story_11_screen_11_button_4_title": "Experience takes time",
  "school_story_11_screen_12_title": "And even if you have quite some time left before you will be an adult and have to earn all of your money.",
  "school_story_11_screen_12_subtitle": "But you are actually allowed to get a job if you have turned 13 years of age. Usually during the summer.",
  "school_story_11_screen_12_button_1_title": "That sounds interesting..,",
  "school_story_11_screen_12_button_2_title": "I'm almost 13!",
  "school_story_11_screen_12_button_3_title": "I'm younger",
  "school_story_11_screen_12_button_4_title": "Work during summer? But that's a break!",
  "school_story_11_screen_13_title": "But there are some rules and restrictions of what you can work with that young, so make sure you know all the rules.",
  "school_story_11_screen_13_subtitle": "In that way you can make sure that you don't get taken advantage of by the person that hires you.",
  "school_story_11_screen_13_button_1_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_11_screen_14_title": "I remember as a pig-teen I got my first ever summer job, the year I turned 13. And I liked it! But I didn't know all the rules and my rights.",
  "school_story_11_screen_14_subtitle": "So I only got paid 15pb an hour. And that is way way too little, it wasn't according to the law.",
  "school_story_11_screen_14_button_1_title": "What was the job?",
  "school_story_11_screen_15_title": "It was on a golf driving range, where people practice their golf swing! I sold sodas and coins for the ball machine. It was fun!",
  "school_story_11_screen_15_subtitle": "But I was fooled and should have earned more. But I didn't know... So check things like that!",
  "school_story_11_screen_15_button_1_title": "Yeah sounds like a good tip",
  "school_story_11_screen_15_button_2_title": "I know the rules already actually!",
  "school_story_11_screen_16_title": "Even if you have a couple of years left until you turn 13, you can do simpler tasks around the house and in the family to earn money.",
  "school_story_11_screen_16_button_1_title": "I do that already!",
  "school_story_11_screen_16_button_2_title": "I don't do that",
  "school_story_11_screen_17_title": "Whatever you decide to do, as with many thing, it's good to start early, with practicing earning I mean. Doing chores, maybe helping neighbours?",
  "school_story_11_screen_17_subtitle": "I will give you some more tips on starting to earn money as a child, so you don't have to wait until you grow up to start earning money!",
  "school_story_11_screen_17_button_1_title": "Yes! I want to know",
  "school_story_11_screen_17_button_2_title": "Now...?",
  "school_story_11_screen_18_title": "I'll tell you after you have done the challenge!",
  "school_story_11_screen_18_button_1_title": "Okay!",
  "school_story_12_screen_1_title": "Ready to learn some mad tips on earning money as a kid?",
  "school_story_12_screen_1_button_1_title": "Am I?!",
  "school_story_12_screen_1_button_2_title": "I was born ready!",
  "school_story_12_screen_2_title": "Awesome! As you can't get a job ‘for real’ until you turn 13, it might be hard to know how to start earning money.",
  "school_story_12_screen_2_subtitle": "But I have some great tips! And like the other things it's very close knitted together with saving and spending...",
  "school_story_12_screen_2_button_1_title": "Piggy, I thought you were talking about earning?",
  "school_story_12_screen_3_title": "I am. But sometimes the tip is about pure earning. And sometimes it's earning by spending or earning by saving.",
  "school_story_12_screen_3_subtitle": "On the planet on saving for example, you will learn that you can earn money by saving, on interest from a bank or bonus!",
  "school_story_12_screen_3_button_1_title": "Earning by spending sounds very weird though?",
  "school_story_12_screen_4_title": "It does sound weird, I agree, but i'll explain more when I get to that tip. Let's talk about the simple earning tips first.",
  "school_story_12_screen_4_button_1_title": "Okay, put it on me",
  "school_story_12_screen_5_title": "Tip nr. 1 is about working, as that is the most classical way to earn money. ‘But hey Piggy’, you might say, ‘I am not old enough to get a job’.",
  "school_story_12_screen_5_subtitle": "Well, that doesn't mean you can't work and earn money! Because if you do chores and get paid, that means you are earning money!",
  "school_story_12_screen_5_button_1_title": "Then I am already earning!",
  "school_story_12_screen_5_button_2_title": "I can start earning that way?",
  "school_story_12_screen_6_title": "Yup! So the first tip is to set up some chores and maybe come up with what could help your parents, and start earning!",
  "school_story_12_screen_6_subtitle": "If you want you can do chores every week to have a steady income, or you can do different things different weeks. It's up to you and your parents.",
  "school_story_12_screen_6_button_1_title": "I will be rich!",
  "school_story_12_screen_6_button_2_title": "I already do chores, how can I earn more?",
  "school_story_12_screen_7_title": "Okay so tip nr. 2 is to try and find more things to help out with outside your home. You could check with grandparents for example.",
  "school_story_12_screen_7_subtitle": "If your parents think it is okay, you can ask neighbours. But check with them first, it's not always the right situation, and maybe you don't live in a neighbourhood where that is okay.",
  "school_story_12_screen_7_button_1_title": "Sounds like a good idea!",
  "school_story_12_screen_7_button_2_title": "That sounds scary",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_title": "Well if you don't want to do that, you could do tip nr.3!",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_subtitle": "You can have a yard sale!",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_button_1_title": "What would I sell?",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_button_2_title": "Where would I do that?",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_button_3_title": "How?",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_button_4_title": "I have done that!",
  "school_story_12_screen_9_title": "There are a couple of different ways you can do it. Firstly you need to have something to sell. Go through your stuff and take the things you don't use anymore.",
  "school_story_12_screen_9_subtitle": "It can be clothes, games, toys or anything really. But always check with your parents. And while you are at it, you can ask if they have anything they want to donate to the yard sale!",
  "school_story_12_screen_9_button_1_title": "I know some things I could sell",
  "school_story_12_screen_9_button_2_title": "I'm listening, go on...",
  "school_story_12_screen_10_title": "Now that you have something to sell you need a way to do it! If you have a yard or garden, you can put up notes of the time and place in the neighbourhood or on social media.",
  "school_story_12_screen_10_subtitle": "But again make sure your parents will be home, and that they agree. You should be safe!",
  "school_story_12_screen_10_button_1_title": "But I don't have a garden",
  "school_story_12_screen_10_button_2_title": "Any other way I could do it?",
  "school_story_12_screen_12_title": "You can also sell things online. Many social media apps have ways to do it, but there are also pure selling sites online.",
  "school_story_12_screen_12_subtitle": "But be careful, some sites want you to pay to sell your things! Make sure you read all the information and if it costs anything.",
  "school_story_12_screen_12_button_1_title": "Oh, cool!",
  "school_story_12_screen_13_title": "When using the internet to sell things it's also important to think about how the person will get the item you sell.",
  "school_story_12_screen_13_subtitle": "Will they pick it up? Or will you send it? You have to have a plan for it before you start.",
  "school_story_12_screen_13_button_1_title": "Oh, maybe a yard sale is better..",
  "school_story_12_screen_13_button_2_title": "Yup, no problem!",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_title": "If you don't have a garden or yard where you can sell things but still want to do a physical yard sale, you can check if there are any yard sales being arranged.",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_subtitle": "There are many yard sales where you can rent a table to sell your things, often there are even children's yard sales, just for kids like you!",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_button_1_title": "That sounds fun!",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_button_2_title": "I'm a bit too shy for that",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_button_3_title": "I'm too lazy for that...",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_button_4_title": "Maybe, I'll think about it",
  "school_story_12_screen_15_title": "I don't want to nag, but when selling things (or earning, spending or saving) It's important to check with your parents.",
  "school_story_12_screen_15_subtitle": "Before you really have financial superskills and you are a bit older, it's good to ask permission and advice from them, because they are still the ones responsible.",
  "school_story_12_screen_15_button_1_title": "Yes, true...",
  "school_story_12_screen_15_button_2_title": "Okay, I will",
  "school_story_12_screen_16_title": "My last tip for now, tip nr. 4, is one of those ‘earning by spending’ tips I talked about.",
  "school_story_12_screen_16_subtitle": "And maybe it's really a savings tip, but as you put in effort it could be earning as well!",
  "school_story_12_screen_16_button_1_title": "Still sounds weird...",
  "school_story_12_screen_16_button_2_title": "I get it!",
  "school_story_12_screen_17_title": "So it's about thinking really hard, planning and comparing prices before you buy something. And maybe even waiting for a sale.",
  "school_story_12_screen_17_subtitle": "Let's say that you have a savings goal you set up. You are saving to buy a...",
  "school_story_12_screen_17_button_1_title": "Cat!",
  "school_story_12_screen_17_button_2_title": "Motorcross!",
  "school_story_12_screen_17_button_3_title": "Gaming console!",
  "school_story_12_screen_17_button_4_title": "None of those!",
  "school_story_12_screen_18_title": "Haha, let's say you save for something simpler, like wireless headphones. While you are saving and waiting to have enough money...",
  "school_story_12_screen_18_subtitle": "...you can start comparing prices in different stores. When you know what pair of headphones you want, you can check what store that has the best price.",
  "school_story_12_screen_18_button_1_title": "That sounds very smart",
  "school_story_12_screen_19_title": "It is very smart, sometimes that could save you a couple of hundreds! And if you are patient and extra nifty, you will plan for a sale...",
  "school_story_12_screen_19_subtitle": "Either plan to buy them during big sales, like Black Friday in November, or the Christmas sales. Or you can wait when you have saved up until a sale shows up.",
  "school_story_12_screen_19_button_1_title": "Oh no I don't like waiting",
  "school_story_12_screen_19_button_2_title": "Sounds hard!",
  "school_story_12_screen_19_button_3_title": "This is really smart!",
  "school_story_12_screen_19_button_4_title": "I always do that!",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_title": "It's true, this can be hard. But if you get a sale that is really good, you can save a lot! If the headphones cost 1000pb. And you save up that much.",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_subtitle": "If you wait for a sale, maybe you can buy them for 700pb, and then you have 300pb left! And as it involved a lot of effort, you can actually say you earned them!",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_button_1_title": "I will try it!",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_button_2_title": "Maybe I'll try...",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_button_3_title": "Didn't think about it that way!",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_button_4_title": "That is a lot!",
  "school_story_12_screen_21_title": "I will leave you with this. You hopefully have a bunch of things to try to earn some money on now!",
  "school_story_12_screen_21_subtitle": "See you on the next planet!",
  "school_story_12_screen_21_button_1_title": "C ya!",
  "school_story_13_screen_1_title": "Congratulations on reaching this planet... because this is a very important planet! Remember, the three staples of personal finances are:",
  "school_story_13_screen_1_subtitle": "Earning, saving and spending.\nYou already learned a bit about earning on planet 4, here we will talk about saving.",
  "school_story_13_screen_1_button_1_title": "Cool!",
  "school_story_13_screen_1_button_2_title": "I want to spend!",
  "school_story_13_screen_1_button_3_title": "Saving is important",
  "school_story_13_screen_1_button_4_title": "I save a lot",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_title": "Before we go on about saving, I wanted to explain another word to you! You know what a product is, it's a thing you can buy. But what about something you buy that is not a thing?",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_subtitle": "That is called a service. Like Netflix, which is a streaming service. Or if you go to a store and pay them to fix your broken screen on the phone, then you buy a service. So you can buy a product, or a service!",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_button_1_title": "Ok, got it!",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_button_2_title": "Nice",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_button_3_title": "I knew that",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_button_4_title": "I didn't know!",
  "school_story_13_screen_3_title": "You probably already know what saving means, but I thought I would explain it a bit deeper.",
  "school_story_13_screen_3_subtitle": "Do you save any money?",
  "school_story_13_screen_3_button_1_title": "Yes, I do!",
  "school_story_13_screen_3_button_2_title": "No, I don't",
  "school_story_13_screen_4_title": "If you do it's great. If you don't, you should really start doing that! Saving is in it's most basic form very simple. It just means that you keep more than you spend.",
  "school_story_13_screen_4_subtitle": "Remember in the beginning, when people used coins? The people that had trouble carrying all their coins, they had so much because they had earned and saved a lot.",
  "school_story_13_screen_4_button_1_title": "They did good!",
  "school_story_13_screen_5_title": "You can see it clearly when you save coins and bills in a piggybank in your house, but also if you save in the piggybank in the Gimi app. The stash grows everytime you save instead of spend!",
  "school_story_13_screen_5_subtitle": "It is very simple math, that you probably already did in the first grades in school. Simple addition and subtraction. ",
  "school_story_13_screen_5_button_1_title": "Yes, I learned that already!",
  "school_story_13_screen_5_button_2_title": "No, haven't been to school yet",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_title": "So you probably know also, that everything can be added and subtracted in the same way. Doesn't matter if it is apples, Robux or money.",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_subtitle": "Let's see if you remember what the words I'm using mean... What is addition?",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_button_1_title": "It's when you add things",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_button_2_title": "It's when you take away things",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_button_3_title": "It's when you divide",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_button_4_title": "It's when you eat the apples",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_title": "It's when you add things! If you have 5 apples, you add 2 and get 7, that's called addition in math.",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_subtitle": "And what is subtraction?",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_button_1_title": "It's when you add things",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_button_2_title": "It's when you take away things",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_button_3_title": "It's when you divide",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_button_4_title": "It's when you eat the apples",
  "school_story_13_screen_8_title": "It's when you take away, or subtract things! If you have 5 apples and take away 2 and have 3 left, that's called subtraction in math.",
  "school_story_13_screen_8_button_1_title": "Yes, yes. I know all this!",
  "school_story_13_screen_8_button_2_title": "Thanks for the reminder!",
  "school_story_13_screen_9_title": "I know that this might be very simple for you but I wanted to explain it, just in case.",
  "school_story_13_screen_9_subtitle": "Also to make you understand that when dealing with money and finances you use math to count everything, and to understand how things are connected. Often very simple math.",
  "school_story_13_screen_9_button_1_title": "You said saving is important?",
  "school_story_13_screen_10_title": "Yes, let's go back to that. I explained the math words, because you can explain it well with math.",
  "school_story_13_screen_10_subtitle": "You should never spend more than you have, right?",
  "school_story_13_screen_10_button_1_title": "Right!",
  "school_story_13_screen_10_button_2_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_13_screen_12_title": "Answering why you should not spend more than you have is where addition and subtraction comes in.",
  "school_story_13_screen_12_subtitle": "If you have those 5 apples, you only have 5 apples. You can't eat more than 5 apples because you don't have anymore.",
  "school_story_13_screen_12_button_1_title": "Yup",
  "school_story_13_screen_13_title": "But if you deal with money, in bank accounts you can sometimes spend more than you have, and get a negative balance in your account.",
  "school_story_13_screen_13_subtitle": "That is bad.",
  "school_story_13_screen_13_button_1_title": "Why is that bad?",
  "school_story_13_screen_14_title": "It is bad because when you spend more than you have, you actually borrow money from the bank. Or somebody else. And loans cost money, like you would buy a product or service.",
  "school_story_13_screen_14_subtitle": "Also, that means you would have less than you started out with, and would have to pay that back, and also earn more to have some money again.",
  "school_story_13_screen_14_button_1_title": "Show me with math!",
  "school_story_13_screen_15_title": "Okay! So, you have 5pb. If you spend 7pb on a candy bar, that means you had to borrow or lend 2pb from the bank.",
  "school_story_13_screen_15_subtitle": "5-7= -2",
  "school_story_13_screen_15_button_1_title": "Looks right",
  "school_story_13_screen_15_button_2_title": "This is such easy math!",
  "school_story_13_screen_16_title": "Next week maybe you want to buy something else for 3pb. But you don't have any money, and you owe the bank 2pb. Also, if you borrowed from the bank, that loan also costs money.",
  "school_story_13_screen_16_subtitle": "Loans from banks and other providers are also a service you have to pay for. So now you owe the bank the 2pb you borrowed, AND the cost of the loan, 0,5pb. If you keep subtracting money and spending, then you will eventually be in debt.",
  "school_story_13_screen_16_button_1_title": "Debt?",
  "school_story_13_screen_16_button_2_title": "Sounds bad?",
  "school_story_13_screen_17_title": "It is bad. I will explain when you get to another planet, about what happens when you overspend, and end up in debt as it is called. You need to know!",
  "school_story_13_screen_17_subtitle": "But by saving, you can make sure you have money when you want to spend it, and make sure that you never have a negative balance!",
  "school_story_13_screen_17_button_1_title": "Tell me more!",
  "school_story_13_screen_17_button_2_title": "YES! tell me!",
  "school_story_13_screen_18_title": "Because by saving, you add instead of subtracting.",
  "school_story_13_screen_18_subtitle": "Of course spending is necessary, and something you should do sometimes. But you should spend in a smart way. And one way of doing that is to save up for things beforehand.",
  "school_story_13_screen_18_button_1_title": "Sounds logical",
  "school_story_13_screen_18_button_2_title": "I want to know more!",
  "school_story_13_screen_19_title": "Let me show you with math again. Let's say you have the same 5pb. You save 3pb every week for three weeks.",
  "school_story_13_screen_19_subtitle": "5+3+3+3= 14",
  "school_story_13_screen_19_button_1_title": "Looks right",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_title": "Now you have 14pb. If you want to buy that candy bar for 7pb, you have 7pb left after the purchase.",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_subtitle": "You still have money left and don't have to borrow or pay any fees for loans!",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_button_1_title": "Saving seems good!",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_button_2_title": "That does sound better",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_button_3_title": "I am still confused",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_button_4_title": "But I don't like saving",
  "school_story_13_screen_21_title": "That is why saving is important. Spending more than you have is more expensive, and can cause a lot of trouble.",
  "school_story_13_screen_21_subtitle": "Always making sure to have some money saved up and to have a buffer is very smart money practice and a real financial superskill!",
  "school_story_13_screen_21_button_1_title": "I will try!",
  "school_story_13_screen_21_button_2_title": "Okay, I want superskills",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_title": "Yup, so to summarize this destination's take-away message:",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_subtitle": "Basic, simple saving is putting away money, letting the sum you have grow over time and earning more than you spend.",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_button_1_title": "Got it!",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_button_2_title": "Yup",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_button_3_title": "I think I understand!",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_button_4_title": "Almost got it now...",
  "school_story_14_screen_1_title": "Hey, good work in the challenge! I was actually just sitting and sorting the coins in my savings.",
  "school_story_14_screen_1_subtitle": "I have done some recycling and helping out around my neighborhood, so I earned some money!",
  "school_story_14_screen_1_button_1_title": "I do that sometimes too",
  "school_story_14_screen_1_button_2_title": "I haven't earned any money yet...",
  "school_story_14_screen_2_title": "Okay, well as you learned on the planet about earning, it's great!",
  "school_story_14_screen_2_subtitle": "I love saving money that I earn, then I can see it grow, almost like a plant!",
  "school_story_14_screen_2_button_1_title": "It's good when money grows!",
  "school_story_14_screen_3_title": "And when I have a savings goal and can see how I get closer to reaching it, it feels great.",
  "school_story_14_screen_3_subtitle": "Now I just have to decide how to save this money I earned. I earned 200pb!",
  "school_story_14_screen_3_button_1_title": "Good job Piggy!",
  "school_story_14_screen_3_button_2_title": "Nice going!",
  "school_story_14_screen_4_title": "I have had my eye on a space scooter for a while now... It's like a regular scooter but with its own atmosphere.",
  "school_story_14_screen_4_subtitle": "Then you don't have to wear a space suit while riding it! And it makes the coolest bluph bluph sound...",
  "school_story_14_screen_4_button_1_title": "Sounds cool, but how about the saving?",
  "school_story_14_screen_5_title": "Right! Sorry! So I will come back to the space scooter, but first I will try to tell you more about why saving is important.",
  "school_story_14_screen_5_button_1_title": "Great, go!",
  "school_story_14_screen_5_button_2_title": "I want a space scooter too!",
  "school_story_14_screen_6_title": "I previously explained that saving is very important so that you don't overspend.",
  "school_story_14_screen_6_subtitle": "Because that makes the things you buy more expensive, and it is very hard to catch up once you go that way.",
  "school_story_14_screen_6_button_1_title": "Yes, because loaning costs money",
  "school_story_14_screen_6_button_2_title": "I remember, I will save instead",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_title": "That is really the most important thing about saving. But it is also true that saving is good because you can get more money by saving!",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_button_1_title": "Oh! Tell me how!",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_button_2_title": "I know this!",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_button_3_title": "Interesting, tell me more!",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_button_4_title": "I will start now!",
  "school_story_14_screen_8_title": "Well, when you save your money in a bank, in what is called a savings account, you earn interest.",
  "school_story_14_screen_8_subtitle": "Interest is a percentage of money the bank gives you for keeping your money there.",
  "school_story_14_screen_8_button_1_title": "Wait, the bank gives me money?",
  "school_story_14_screen_9_title": "You can say that. What happens is that by keeping your money in the bank, you actually loan your money to them.",
  "school_story_14_screen_9_subtitle": "And the bank pays you for that loan by giving interest on your money. So the longer you keep them there and the more you save, the more you earn!",
  "school_story_14_screen_9_button_1_title": "That sound great!",
  "school_story_14_screen_9_button_2_title": "That seems risky?",
  "school_story_14_screen_10_title": "The banks guarantee that you will get your money back in the regular saving accounts. But you usually lock them for a time, but after you get them all back, + interest!",
  "school_story_14_screen_10_subtitle": "There are other ways to save where there also is a risk of loosing some, but that gives even more interest.",
  "school_story_14_screen_10_button_1_title": "I want to earn more, tell me how!",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_title": "Let's wait a bit with those, because it's a bit more you need to know before.",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_subtitle": "There are many different ways to save, but generally they can be divided into long-term saving and short-term saving.",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_button_1_title": "Okay, long-term and short-term",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_button_2_title": "Yes, I get it!",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_button_3_title": "What is long-term?",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_button_4_title": "What is short-term?",
  "school_story_14_screen_13_title": "Let's start with short-term saving. ",
  "school_story_14_screen_13_subtitle": "The simplest way of short-term saving is to put away your money, and try not to spend them.",
  "school_story_14_screen_13_button_1_title": "Sounds too simple",
  "school_story_14_screen_13_button_2_title": "But that's kinda hard",
  "school_story_14_screen_14_title": "It can be pretty hard! But in that way you make sure that you have money for the things you really need or want.",
  "school_story_14_screen_14_subtitle": "The money disappears quickly when you buy a soda here and an ice cream there...",
  "school_story_14_screen_14_button_1_title": "I noticed!",
  "school_story_14_screen_14_button_2_title": "I know, that's why I save!",
  "school_story_14_screen_15_title": "Another way of short-term saving, is when you save up for something that may not be that expensive.",
  "school_story_14_screen_15_subtitle": "So you save your money, but maybe not in a savings account, because you don't want to lock them.",
  "school_story_14_screen_15_button_1_title": "Got it!",
  "school_story_14_screen_16_title": "Long-term saving as you might suspect, is when you save for a long time.",
  "school_story_14_screen_16_button_1_title": "Yup, simple",
  "school_story_14_screen_17_title": "Long-term savings can also be for different lengths of time. For example saving for something very expensive like a new smartphone.",
  "school_story_14_screen_17_subtitle": "That would take some time to save up to, maybe even a couple of years if you don't earn extra money. But there are long-term savings that last almost your entire life!",
  "school_story_14_screen_17_button_1_title": "Wow, that's so long!",
  "school_story_14_screen_17_button_2_title": "I have saved for years already!",
  "school_story_14_screen_18_title": "Yes saving really shouldn't ever end. The best way is to have a balance between long-term and short-term savings.",
  "school_story_14_screen_18_subtitle": "And you don't have to think about the really long-term savings yet, but when you become an adult you should start as soon as possible.",
  "school_story_14_screen_18_button_1_title": "Phew, good",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_title": "Okay, I decided. I will divide the money I earned into both long-term and short-term saving!",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_subtitle": "I earned 200pb right? I will put away 150pb, long-term for the space scooter.",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_button_1_title": "Only 150pb?",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_button_2_title": "Why not the full 200pb?",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_button_3_title": "So much?",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_button_4_title": "But then you have 50pb left",
  "school_story_14_screen_20_title": "Yes, well, I want to save the remaining 50pb in short-term savings. So that I have some left to spend.",
  "school_story_14_screen_20_subtitle": "But only when I need to. I would love some chocolate right now, but I'll skip it. I'll save.",
  "school_story_14_screen_20_button_1_title": "Sounds smart",
  "school_story_14_screen_20_button_2_title": "Sounds tough",
  "school_story_14_screen_21_title": "I'll go do that right now. Go practice in the challenge and I'll teach you some smart ways to save in the next story!",
  "school_story_14_screen_21_button_1_title": "Okay, bye",
  "school_story_15_screen_1_title": "If I remember correctly, I promised to teach you even more about saving, specifically smart and savvy ways of doing it?",
  "school_story_15_screen_1_button_1_title": "Yes, that's right!",
  "school_story_15_screen_1_button_2_title": "I don't remember much after the challenge",
  "school_story_15_screen_2_title": "We went through long and short-term savings, but I think I mentioned something about a savings buffer...?",
  "school_story_15_screen_2_button_1_title": "Yes, and I'm curious",
  "school_story_15_screen_2_button_2_title": "No..? Tell me about it!",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_title": "Haha sorry, I‘m a bit tired, I counted my money until late last night...",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_subtitle": "PLZ_CHECK Okay. Nevermind. Savings buffer is the topic. A buffer is store of something. In finance, it means that you save up a store, or buffer, of money.",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_button_1_title": "Is my piggybank a buffer?",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_button_2_title": "Hmm... I need to know more",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_button_3_title": "I think I have a savings account",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_button_4_title": "Don't have one, I spent it",
  "school_story_15_screen_4_title": "Your piggybank could be a savings buffer. It depends on if you have some money saved up. More than you spend.",
  "school_story_15_screen_4_subtitle": "A savings buffer is often what the short time saving that you learned about in the previous story is called.",
  "school_story_15_screen_4_button_1_title": "But what is it for again?",
  "school_story_15_screen_5_title": "Well, like I said it is when you save more than you spend, but you save it ‘for a rainy day’",
  "school_story_15_screen_5_button_1_title": "What's the difference from short-term saving?",
  "school_story_15_screen_6_title": "The difference is, that you are not saving up for something specific, you are just saving in case something comes up.",
  "school_story_15_screen_6_subtitle": "It's very important as an adult, as things that are important and expensive can break. Like the car or the heating if you live in a house.",
  "school_story_15_screen_6_button_1_title": "Okay, I get it!",
  "school_story_15_screen_6_button_2_title": "Coolio",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_title": "If the car breaks and it is an expensive repair, maybe you can't afford it after you have payed your bills.",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_subtitle": "But you have to repair it, because you might not get to work otherwise! If you have a savings buffer you have the extra money to pay, without ruining your budget.",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_button_1_title": "But I am not an adult...",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_button_2_title": "I don't think I need a buffer?",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_button_3_title": "I will start when I grow up",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_button_4_title": "So I can spend now?",
  "school_story_15_screen_8_title": "But it is important for everyone! Even children... cool kids like you as well. Firstly, like with all finance and money matters it's very important to practice early.",
  "school_story_15_screen_8_subtitle": "These money matters are hard for adults too, and the earlier you start the good habits and practice, the better you will get! That goes for all financial superskills!",
  "school_story_15_screen_8_button_1_title": "Okay, I get it, what else?",
  "school_story_15_screen_8_button_2_title": "Oh, okay",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_title": "And secondly, you can also have things happen that you have to pay for, that you didn't expect. Let's say you just got a new smartphone.",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_subtitle": "You drop it, and the screen breaks. Your parents tell you that you should have taken care of it better, and that you have to pay for it yourself.",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_button_1_title": "😱",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_button_2_title": "🤯",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_button_3_title": "😬",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_button_4_title": "😭",
  "school_story_15_screen_10_title": "If you don't have a savings buffer, you would have to save for a long time to get the screen fixed. It's quite expensive!",
  "school_story_15_screen_10_subtitle": "And... hmmm, hint, hint. Maybe you should also buy a screen protector.",
  "school_story_15_screen_10_button_1_title": "Oh, for sure",
  "school_story_15_screen_10_button_2_title": "I would have to save for months!",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_title": "Yes, well instead imagine that you had a savings buffer. Depending on the size of your buffer it could shorten the time before you can afford to fix the screen...",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_subtitle": "Or if it is large enough, maybe you can afford it immediately! And not go around for a long time with a broken screen...",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_button_1_title": "Sounds great",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_button_2_title": "It does sound smart",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_button_3_title": "I think I will have to start building one",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_button_4_title": "Naaah...",
  "school_story_15_screen_13_title": "Let me tell you about some smart ways and hacks that can help you save more!",
  "school_story_15_screen_13_subtitle": "My first tip is about bonus! As a kid it might be hard to get accounts and interest from banks. But in the Gimi app you can get bonus!",
  "school_story_15_screen_13_button_1_title": "I love hacks!",
  "school_story_15_screen_13_button_2_title": "What is bonus?",
  "school_story_15_screen_14_title": "Bonus works like interest. But your parents pay it for the money you save in your Gimi piggybank!",
  "school_story_15_screen_14_subtitle": "You can agree and discuss with your parents what the rate should be, and then when you have payday you will get extra money!",
  "school_story_15_screen_14_button_1_title": "I want bonus!",
  "school_story_15_screen_14_button_2_title": "I have bonus",
  "school_story_15_screen_15_title": "PLZ_CHECK Interest rate if you remember, is a percentage from the banks in savings accounts, and bonus works the same way. Let's say you have 100pb in your piggybank.",
  "school_story_15_screen_15_subtitle": "If you have a bonus rate of 5%, after payday you will have 5pb extra, just from bonus!",
  "school_story_15_screen_15_button_1_title": "Saving money really pays off!",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_title": "Yup! My second tip is something called ‘matched saving’. It's really simple, it's saving some yourself and getting the same amount for it.",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_subtitle": "If you ask your parents, or another family member and see if they would like to negotiate a deal to encourage you and help you to save. Maybe if you save up 100, they will give you 100?",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_button_1_title": "I can try",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_button_2_title": "Nah, seems like a lot of work",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_title": "I don't know, it depends on your family, remember to ask and negotiate in a nice professional manner, don't demand! They don't owe you or have to agree.",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_subtitle": "Okay, so another hack is to set saving goals. Actually, I have seen that kids that use the goal map in the app and set savings goals are generally better at saving!",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_button_1_title": "What? Really?",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_button_2_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_button_3_title": "I use it, am I better at saving?",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_button_4_title": "How does that work?",
  "school_story_15_screen_18_title": "It is true! So the researchers can't say for sure why, but they can make educated guesses and they think, it's because it is motivating to see your progress!",
  "school_story_15_screen_18_subtitle": "So if you're not using it already and want to get better at saving, use the goal map! Or make your own! The important part is to set a savings goal and check on how it's going along the way.",
  "school_story_15_screen_18_button_1_title": "Okay, cool. Anymore tips or hacks?",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_title": "Yup, I have one last tip, and this one you can do all by yourself! It's called the ‘the round-up method.’",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_subtitle": "It's a hack, where you always put away or save some money when you buy things.",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_1_title": "Wait, what?",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_2_title": "How does that work?",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_3_title": "I know this one!",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_4_title": "...by rounding up?",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_title": "This is also simple, and a way to trick yourself to save often but just a little. But you know what they say: ‘from acorns grow oak trees,’ every little helps!",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_subtitle": "So every time you buy something, you round up to the closest 10, or whatever you decide, and you put away the difference in savings.",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_button_1_title": "I think I understand...",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_button_2_title": "Can you please give an example?",
  "school_story_15_screen_21_title": "Okay, an example is that you buy a pizza. The pizza costs 85pb. If you round up to the nearest 10, that is 90pb. The difference between 85 and 90 is 5. You then take 5pb and put in savings.",
  "school_story_15_screen_21_subtitle": "Or you buy a hat, you pay 349pb, you round up to 350, the difference is 1pb, so you put that in savings.",
  "school_story_15_screen_21_button_1_title": "Sounds like I would save very little?",
  "school_story_15_screen_22_title": "Yes it's a little every time, but that makes it easy and you don't notice it much. And you do it many times! So it collects! It becomes a way to trick yourself into saving! And everything you save is great!",
  "school_story_15_screen_22_subtitle": "Okay, I think you are ready for the challenge! And try one of the tips!",
  "school_story_15_screen_22_button_1_title": "Okay, I'm out!",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_title": "Alright! Now we're going to shop until we drop! No sorry. I have to stay here with my cat Fido. She hates crowds...",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_subtitle": "...and strangely enough the smell of money being spent! Crazy cat.",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_button_1_title": "Very weird!",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_button_2_title": "Must be a thrifty cat?",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_button_3_title": "Is it really called Fido?",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_button_4_title": "It might be able to help you save!",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_title": "But, let's talk! And we'll talk about spending and different ways to pay.",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_subtitle": "Yeah, I think I’ll start as I usually do; with a question! What is spending?",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_button_1_title": "Getting rid of something?",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_button_2_title": "Getting rid of money?",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_button_3_title": "Buying things, right?",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_button_4_title": "I'm not sure",
  "school_story_16_screen_3_title": "It can be difficult to define when you do not specify what you are talking about, because you can spend a lot of other things besides money.",
  "school_story_16_screen_3_subtitle": "You can spend time, for example, and you can spend the summer resting your brain. And of course you spend money.",
  "school_story_16_screen_3_button_1_title": "Yes! Great way to spend the summer!",
  "school_story_16_screen_3_button_2_title": "I like to use my brain",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_title": "And the very word spend means 'using something with the understanding that it can end'. Which is very suitable for just money!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_subtitle": "If you just spend money, they will run out. That's exactly why you earn and save: to be able to spend money without running out!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_button_1_title": "Yes! Now I see the connection!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_button_2_title": "Ah, I understand better now",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_button_3_title": "I’ve known that for a long time!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_button_4_title": "Ah, I’ll have to think about this",
  "school_story_16_screen_5_title": "If you also spend smart, they will last even longer and for more things!",
  "school_story_16_screen_5_button_1_title": "That’s a good deal!",
  "school_story_16_screen_6_title": "What you do when you spend money is that you pay for things. It can be that you buy products or services you want, or pay bills that are necessary.",
  "school_story_16_screen_6_subtitle": "That's why I thought you need to know about different ways to pay and how they work.",
  "school_story_16_screen_6_button_1_title": "Sounds reasonable",
  "school_story_16_screen_7_title": "Today, much of our money is digital, and that means we have lots of solutions for how to pay. In addition to all the usual ones.",
  "school_story_16_screen_7_subtitle": "I can name a few. You can pay with your phone in several ways, like Swish or AppleWallet. You can even pay with your smartwatch!",
  "school_story_16_screen_7_button_1_title": "I haven’t thought about how many there are!",
  "school_story_16_screen_7_button_2_title": "I have used several of them",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_title": "In the destinations on this planet, we will talk about more classic ways of paying.",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_subtitle": "We do this because the new digital solutions are all based on them.",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_button_1_title": "Ah, okay!",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_button_2_title": "I didn’t know!",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_button_3_title": "Yep!",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_button_4_title": "Now I want to know more",
  "school_story_16_screen_9_title": "For example, you can pay with AppleWallet because you have entered information from your bank card...",
  "school_story_16_screen_9_subtitle": "...if you want to be picky, you are actually paying with your card, but THROUGH your phone. So that’s the classic way you need to understand first!",
  "school_story_16_screen_9_button_1_title": "I'm actually learning a lot",
  "school_story_16_screen_9_button_2_title": "I knew about most of this",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_title": "Okay, then we start by going through different types of cards you can pay with, important similarities and how they differ.",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_subtitle": "To spend wisely is to choose the right payment method.",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_button_1_title": "Easy peasy!",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_button_2_title": "I already do that",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_button_3_title": "That doesn’t sound difficult",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_button_4_title": "Okay, let’s go!",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_title": "Paying by card may sound easy, but do you know what actually happens when you blip a card or enter the card number when shopping online?",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_button_1_title": "Honestly, no",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_button_2_title": "Money disappears right?",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_button_3_title": "The bank gets a notification?",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_button_4_title": "I get poor",
  "school_story_16_screen_13_title": "The answer is actually that different things can happens. Because it depends on what type of card you have. Look! It's already more complicated than you think.",
  "school_story_16_screen_13_subtitle": "The four most common card types are prepaid cards, debit cards, credit cards and charge cards.",
  "school_story_16_screen_13_button_1_title": "Okay, I did not know about them all",
  "school_story_16_screen_13_button_2_title": "Wow, so many different ones",
  "school_story_16_screen_14_title": "We’ll take them one at a time. I can start by mentioning that the prepaid card and the bank card are very similar.",
  "school_story_16_screen_14_subtitle": "They are both in the category of cards where you have to have money before you can pay with the card. Both work a bit like a modern and digitized version of the old classic wallet.",
  "school_story_16_screen_14_button_1_title": "Old? My wallet is new!",
  "school_story_16_screen_14_button_2_title": "Okay... continue",
  "school_story_16_screen_15_title": "If you go out on the town with a wallet and have to pay with cash, then you have to make sure you have money in your wallet.",
  "school_story_16_screen_15_subtitle": "When you shop, you can only buy things as long as you have enough money left.",
  "school_story_16_screen_15_button_1_title": "I get it, nice comparison",
  "school_story_16_screen_15_button_2_title": "Hmm, tell me more",
  "school_story_16_screen_16_title": "When your wallet is empty, it's empty, right? Then you've spent everything.",
  "school_story_16_screen_16_subtitle": "And the exact same thing applies to prepaid cards and debit cards.",
  "school_story_16_screen_16_button_1_title": "I see how they are similar",
  "school_story_16_screen_16_button_2_title": "But, how are they different then?",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_title": "Let me tell you more about how the first and easiest card works.",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_subtitle": "The prepaid card looks like a regular card.",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_button_1_title": "What does an unusual card look like?",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_button_2_title": "Like a bank card then?",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_button_3_title": "Yes, I have seen one",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_button_4_title": "I think I have one",
  "school_story_16_screen_18_title": "But it works like a gift card or bus card, because you have to 'charge' it with money before using it.",
  "school_story_16_screen_18_subtitle": "Have you heard of such cards before?",
  "school_story_16_screen_18_button_1_title": "Nope!",
  "school_story_16_screen_18_button_2_title": "Yep!",
  "school_story_16_screen_19_title": "Prepaid cards are actually more common than you might think, especially among children and young people.",
  "school_story_16_screen_19_subtitle": "Parents put money on the card, such as weekly or monthly allowances, or Christmas gift money and then you shop! So it's the same as getting cash in hand, but digitally!",
  "school_story_16_screen_19_button_1_title": "U-hu, I see",
  "school_story_16_screen_19_button_2_title": "I have a card like that!",
  "school_story_16_screen_20_title": "The Gimi card, which parents can order for their children in the app, actually works just like that. It is a prepaid card you can shop with.",
  "school_story_16_screen_20_subtitle": "Many prepaid cards are linked to an app where you can keep track of the balance, how much money you have left.",
  "school_story_16_screen_20_button_1_title": "I'm with you!",
  "school_story_16_screen_20_button_2_title": "Lots to keep track of",
  "school_story_16_screen_21_title": "And you have to keep track of the balance, because if the money is gone you can not shop with the card!",
  "school_story_16_screen_21_subtitle": "Now I'm sending you to do the challenge. This was a lot! Practice this, and we'll be moving on to the next story.",
  "school_story_16_screen_21_button_1_title": "Great idea, I need a break",
  "school_story_16_screen_21_button_2_title": "I'm off, so see you soon!",
  "school_story_17_screen_1_title": "I hope it went well and that you got to practice a bit on what you learned!",
  "school_story_17_screen_1_subtitle": "The last thing we talked about before the challenge was the prepaid card.",
  "school_story_17_screen_1_button_1_title": "That seems to be the case!",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_title": "And how important it is to keep track of the balance. Which is how much money is on the card just when you checked. How much money you have in an account is also called balance.",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_subtitle": "And it was important to keep track of because...",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_button_1_title": "It is not possible to shop without money on the card",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_button_2_title": "It is good to be aware of",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_button_3_title": "Unclear",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_button_4_title": "To complain and get more",
  "school_story_17_screen_3_title": "The answer is that it is not possible to shop if the balance is too low. The same applies to the debit card, the purchase does not go through, as it is called.",
  "school_story_17_screen_3_subtitle": "In that way they are the same. We said that they belonged to the category of cards where you have to have money before you can pay with the cards.",
  "school_story_17_screen_3_button_1_title": "I remember that!",
  "school_story_17_screen_3_button_2_title": "Now I will probably remember",
  "school_story_17_screen_4_title": "The difference between a prepaid card and a debit card is that the debit card does not carry money but is linked to an account at the bank.",
  "school_story_17_screen_4_subtitle": "And it's in the account where the money is.",
  "school_story_17_screen_4_button_1_title": "I’m with you!",
  "school_story_17_screen_4_button_2_title": "Yep",
  "school_story_17_screen_5_title": "Because the debit card is connected to the account, the money is withdrawn from the account when you use it the store or online.",
  "school_story_17_screen_5_subtitle": "But of course, someone needs to put the money into the account first, otherwise the balance will be 0!",
  "school_story_17_screen_5_button_1_title": "My parents or supporters!",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_title": "If you try to shop with a prepaid card or a debit card when the money runs out, an error message will appear.",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_subtitle": "It will say that it is not possible to complete the purchase. Then you have to leave without the thing you wanted to buy.",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_button_1_title": "It's happened to me!",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_button_2_title": "Good to know!",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_button_3_title": "Embarrassing, not being able to pay",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_button_4_title": "I know this",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_title": "What do you think seems smart to do to avoid getting an error message and being forced to return what you intended to buy?",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_button_1_title": "Call a parent",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_button_2_title": "Check the balance before",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_button_3_title": "Pay only with cash",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_button_4_title": "None of the options",
  "school_story_17_screen_8_title": "The best answer is to keep track of the balance. A tip is to go into your bank app or your digital piggy bank often to check it.",
  "school_story_17_screen_8_subtitle": "If you shop a lot, then maybe at least every morning and evening. That way you can easily understand where your money is going and how much you can shop for.",
  "school_story_17_screen_8_button_1_title": "Smart tip!",
  "school_story_17_screen_8_button_2_title": "I’ll think about it!",
  "school_story_17_screen_9_title": "I was talking about the same thing when we went through the very first chapter. I quickly mention budget back then right?",
  "school_story_17_screen_9_subtitle": "Anyway, I already said then that it is important to keep track of money you get in and what you spend. Then you avoid shopping for more than you have!",
  "school_story_17_screen_9_button_1_title": "And you will probably say it more times",
  "school_story_17_screen_11_title": "Yeah! I'll ago on about that haha.",
  "school_story_17_screen_11_subtitle": "Now you have learned how two cards you can pay with work. Prepaid cards and debit cards.",
  "school_story_17_screen_11_button_1_title": "That's right",
  "school_story_17_screen_12_title": "Now we move on to two other types of cards you can pay with.",
  "school_story_17_screen_12_subtitle": "And these two cards are in the second category: cards where you do NOT have to have the money when you pay with the card.",
  "school_story_17_screen_12_button_1_title": "That sounds weird",
  "school_story_17_screen_12_button_2_title": "Can you just shop then?",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_title": "The first thing in the category we are going to talk about is credit cards.",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_subtitle": "Do you know what it is",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_button_1_title": "Of course!",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_button_2_title": "Don't know",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_button_3_title": "Uhm... nah",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_button_4_title": "I recognize it",
  "school_story_17_screen_14_title": "Most credit cards are also linked to your bank account, just as debit cards. But if you buy something with a credit card, you do not have to have all the money needed in the account.",
  "school_story_17_screen_14_subtitle": "You then shop ’on credit’. This means that when you shop for more money than you have in the account, you borrow the extra money from the bank.",
  "school_story_17_screen_14_button_1_title": "I'm aware of that",
  "school_story_17_screen_14_button_2_title": "News to me",
  "school_story_17_screen_15_title": "Then you owe the bank money later. We loosely talked about it already on the planet about spending.",
  "school_story_17_screen_15_subtitle": "You usually have one month to pay back the money without anything happening. If you do not pay back within that time, the bank charges an interest rate.",
  "school_story_17_screen_15_button_1_title": "Was not interest something you got?",
  "school_story_17_screen_15_button_2_title": "Exactly, interest can be earned or paid!",
  "school_story_17_screen_16_title": "Interest in this case is the cost you pay to borrow the money from the bank. Because it is a service you buy. Then you have to pay back both the debt AND extra money in interest.",
  "school_story_17_screen_16_subtitle": "Let’s look at an example!",
  "school_story_17_screen_16_button_1_title": "An example is probably good!",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_title": "You buy a jacket for 600pb but only have 200pb in the account. You pay with a credit card, which means that you borrow 400pb from the bank and can buy the jacket.",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_subtitle": "You can not afford to repay your borrowed money to the bank on time, which means that the bank pays an interest rate of 10%. How much do you owe the bank in total now?",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_button_1_title": "440pb",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_button_2_title": "460pb",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_button_3_title": "660pb",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_button_4_title": "420pb",
  "school_story_17_screen_18_title": "The correct answer is 440pb",
  "school_story_17_screen_18_subtitle": "It is the debt of 400pb, + interest 400 * 0.1 = 40pb. In this way you have paid 640pb for the jacket instead of 600pb",
  "school_story_17_screen_18_button_1_title": "Oh",
  "school_story_17_screen_18_button_2_title": "I understand",
  "school_story_17_screen_19_title": "The last card I will tell you about is a charge card. If you shop with a charge card, you borrow all the money you shop for.",
  "school_story_17_screen_19_subtitle": "Everything you buy is then collected on an invoice, a bill, which you get once a month. As with the credit card, nothing happens if you pay on time...",
  "school_story_17_screen_19_button_1_title": "Cool card!",
  "school_story_17_screen_19_button_2_title": "Scary to borrow all the money!",
  "school_story_17_screen_20_title": "...but if you don’t, it will quickly become very expensive!",
  "school_story_17_screen_20_subtitle": "These were the cards! In the next story, you will learn about invoices.",
  "school_story_17_screen_20_button_1_title": "Okay!",
  "school_story_18_screen_1_title": "As you have noticed by now, there are many words to keep in mind when it comes to personal economics.",
  "school_story_18_screen_1_subtitle": "Sometimes a word can mean different things. Like interest. It can be both interest you earn when saving, but also interest you have to pay for borrowing money from the bank.",
  "school_story_18_screen_1_button_1_title": "Sometimes it's messy",
  "school_story_18_screen_1_button_2_title": "I think I’ve got a handle on it",
  "school_story_18_screen_2_title": "And some words mean the same thing. For example, invoice and bill.",
  "school_story_18_screen_2_subtitle": "And that's exactly what we're going to talk about now, but I'll just use the word invoice.",
  "school_story_18_screen_2_button_1_title": "I knew that!",
  "school_story_18_screen_2_button_2_title": "Invoice and bill are the same thing!",
  "school_story_18_screen_3_title": "An invoice is actually a kind of letter of debt or contract that you owe money.",
  "school_story_18_screen_3_subtitle": "You receive invoices both at home in the mailbox, and in many different digital ways. It is important to know where the different invoices you get end up so you are aware them.",
  "school_story_18_screen_3_button_1_title": "There is a lot to keep track of",
  "school_story_18_screen_4_title": "But where do the invoices come from? Well, it's a way of delayed payment, so not directly at the time of purchase. Here's how: You buy something, do not pay right then and there, and then get an invoice and a certain time to pay it by.",
  "school_story_18_screen_4_subtitle": "It's a very convenient way to pay for things you use all the time. Like electricity! Imagine if you had to pay directly every time you turn on a light or charge your phone.",
  "school_story_18_screen_4_button_1_title": "That would be unreasonable!",
  "school_story_18_screen_4_button_2_title": "That would have been hard",
  "school_story_18_screen_5_title": "But you can get invoices for many things, both for products, services and such things as phone bills, electricity as I mentioned, or for charge cards we talked about at the previous destination.",
  "school_story_18_screen_5_button_1_title": "So for like everything, haha",
  "school_story_18_screen_5_button_2_title": "Oh, I wouldn’t have thought that",
  "school_story_18_screen_6_title": "How long you have to pay the invoice is different, the company you bought from decides that. It can be anything from a few days to a few months.",
  "school_story_18_screen_6_subtitle": "But a tip is that you always check how much time you have on you when you buy something on an invoice, so you can afford to pay it before the time expires.",
  "school_story_18_screen_6_button_1_title": "Smart!",
  "school_story_18_screen_6_button_2_title": "Seems unnecessary",
  "school_story_18_screen_7_title": "The latest date on which the money has to be paid is called the due date.",
  "school_story_18_screen_7_subtitle": "It always says on the invoice. It is important to keep in mind that the due date is NOT the day you pay, but the day the company should have received the money.",
  "school_story_18_screen_7_button_1_title": "Due date - Complicated word",
  "school_story_18_screen_7_button_2_title": "I’ll make sure to be careful about that",
  "school_story_18_screen_8_title": "So you have to make sure to pay the money on time, sometimes it can take a few days before the money arrives.",
  "school_story_18_screen_8_subtitle": "Well, I think that’s all there is to know about invoices.",
  "school_story_18_screen_8_button_1_title": "Hey, not so fast! How do you pay them for example?",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_title": "Just wanted to make sure you were with me! Of course there’s more to know. So we'll keep going.",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_subtitle": "Payment you said. Well you pay them with the help of your bank. What you do is you transfer money from your own account, to the company’s account.",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_button_1_title": "Wow, sounds hard!",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_button_2_title": "Does it take a long time?",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_button_3_title": "Do I have to go to the bank?",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_button_4_title": "Explain more",
  "school_story_18_screen_11_title": "It probably sounds more complicated than it is. You do everything digitally on the internet. But there are a few different ways to do it.",
  "school_story_18_screen_11_subtitle": "You have to keep track of them all, because it is the companies that decide how you can pay them.",
  "school_story_18_screen_11_button_1_title": "Yeah, okay",
  "school_story_18_screen_11_button_2_title": "Why do they have to decide everything?",
  "school_story_18_screen_12_title": "Let’s go through the most common ones.",
  "school_story_18_screen_12_subtitle": "If you receive your invoice by letter home, you have to pay through your internet bank. In this case you have to keep track of different information, because you have to fill in everything yourself.",
  "school_story_18_screen_12_button_1_title": "What kind of information?",
  "school_story_18_screen_13_title": "Simply put, you have to fill in: how much to pay, to whom it should be paid and who is paying. All this information is on the invoice.",
  "school_story_18_screen_13_subtitle": "The simplest part is how much to pay. It's called amount.",
  "school_story_18_screen_13_button_1_title": "I recognize that",
  "school_story_18_screen_13_button_2_title": "Okay, pretty easy",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_title": "To whom it should be paid is also easy, because it is the company's bank account. In Sweden such accounts are called bankgiro or plusgiro, and is a number you fill in.",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_subtitle": "How do you know the number then?",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_button_1_title": "Call a friend",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_button_2_title": "Ask the bank",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_button_3_title": "On the invoice!",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_button_4_title": "You come up with one!",
  "school_story_18_screen_15_title": "Because these invoices are handled automatically by companies, you can not just write your name so they know who the payment is from.",
  "school_story_18_screen_15_subtitle": "Instead, you write in an OCR number. It's a long number that doesn't really matter, other than that it tells the company when they receive the payment that you paid your invoice.",
  "school_story_18_screen_15_button_1_title": "I’ll guess! The number is on the invoice!",
  "school_story_18_screen_16_title": "Haha quite right! Sometimes there is no OCR number, but then it usually says what to write instead, so they know who the payment is from.",
  "school_story_18_screen_16_subtitle": "However, you often get your invoices digitally. Then this information is almost always filled in already. Then you just need to approve the payment and sign with bank ID.",
  "school_story_18_screen_16_button_1_title": "Yes, that sounds easy",
  "school_story_18_screen_16_button_2_title": "Why aren’t they all like that?",
  "school_story_18_screen_17_title": "The last way that I’m going to mention this time is a way that is very smooth, but it does not suit everyone and you can not choose it with all companies.",
  "school_story_18_screen_17_subtitle": "It is called direct debit. Then you can accept that the money is automatically deducted from your account every month. It fits well if it is something you pay for every month, so you do not have to do so much.",
  "school_story_18_screen_17_button_1_title": "An invoice payment subscription!",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_title": "Good explanation, one could call it that. Now you know that there are many different ways to pay, And to spend smart you have to make sure not to use a way that makes you pay more in the long run.",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_subtitle": "What do you think is the best way to spend?",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_button_1_title": "By credit card",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_button_2_title": "To save until you can afford it",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_button_3_title": "Borrow money when you don’t have it",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_button_4_title": "Steal it instead!",
  "school_story_18_screen_19_title": "Hmm... Interesting...",
  "school_story_18_screen_19_subtitle": "And what do you think I believe is the best way to spend?",
  "school_story_18_screen_19_button_1_title": "By credit card",
  "school_story_18_screen_19_button_2_title": "To save until you can afford it",
  "school_story_18_screen_19_button_3_title": "Borrow money when you don’t have it",
  "school_story_18_screen_19_button_4_title": "Steal it instead!",
  "school_story_18_screen_20_title": "Of course I think you should save until you can afford it instead of buying on credit, I'm a thrifty pig.",
  "school_story_18_screen_20_subtitle": "It's easy to get into big debt and then it's hard to make up for it later. When it comes to money, it's natural to spend, but you should not spend so it runs out!",
  "school_story_18_screen_20_button_1_title": "Word, Piggy",
  "school_story_19_screen_1_title": "What actually happens if you do not pay what you owe? It's of course a little different HOW you do it!",
  "school_story_19_screen_1_subtitle": "Because if you're in a store and run out with a product without paying, it's shoplifting, even theft.",
  "school_story_19_screen_1_button_1_title": "...and then the police will come",
  "school_story_19_screen_1_button_2_title": "Stealing is very wrong!",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_title": "That's right! And if you have received a product or service and you have promised to pay, then you have entered into an agreement. And then you become liable for payment.",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_subtitle": "Not paying when you have to, also has consequences. Even if it's not the same as stealing in a store, you will not get away.",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_button_1_title": "But I'm a fast runner! Only joking!",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_button_2_title": "I do not like consequences",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_button_3_title": "Yes, that's obvious!",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_button_4_title": "A promise is a promise",
  "school_story_19_screen_3_title": "You already know about different ways to pay, if you did planet 6. But everything is really the same:",
  "school_story_19_screen_3_subtitle": "a way to pay for what you want to buy. Do you remember any of the ways?",
  "school_story_19_screen_3_button_1_title": "In installments?",
  "school_story_19_screen_3_button_2_title": "With Starcoin?",
  "school_story_19_screen_3_button_3_title": "Bake cookies as thank you?",
  "school_story_19_screen_3_button_4_title": "No...",
  "school_story_19_screen_4_title": "Often, nowadays, you can even choose how you want to pay. Like when I bought a glass figurine of myself online last week.",
  "school_story_19_screen_4_subtitle": "Then I could choose between paying directly, by card or Swish for example, or paying later.",
  "school_story_19_screen_4_button_1_title": "That's right!",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_title": "If you choose to pay later, you will receive an invoice, or bill as it is also called. The invoice contains all the information you need, especially the date when it must be paid at the latest.",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_subtitle": "If you don't do that, you will owe money. If you owe any money, it is called that you have a debt.",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_button_1_title": "I knew that",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_button_2_title": "I have no debt",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_button_3_title": "I have a debt",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_button_4_title": "Never heard of invoice",
  "school_story_19_screen_6_title": "But hey?",
  "school_story_19_screen_6_subtitle": "Have you thought about what happens if you do not pay the bill?",
  "school_story_19_screen_6_button_1_title": "No, never",
  "school_story_19_screen_6_button_2_title": "Yes I have actually!",
  "school_story_19_screen_7_title": "Let's say you buy a game that costs 200pb and you choose to pay by invoice.",
  "school_story_19_screen_7_button_1_title": "Okay, sure",
  "school_story_19_screen_8_title": "At this store you have 30 days to pay the invoice. But as you know, it can vary depending on which company you shop at.",
  "school_story_19_screen_8_subtitle": "What do you think they will do if you do not pay within 30 days?",
  "school_story_19_screen_8_button_1_title": "They might... no, I do not know",
  "school_story_19_screen_8_button_2_title": "Nothing at all",
  "school_story_19_screen_8_button_3_title": "They send a reminder",
  "school_story_19_screen_8_button_4_title": "They call and yell at me",
  "school_story_19_screen_9_title": "Yes, then they will send you a reminder.",
  "school_story_19_screen_9_button_1_title": "Ok, that doesn't sound too bad...",
  "school_story_19_screen_11_title": "Well, that might not be so awful. But.",
  "school_story_19_screen_11_subtitle": "Because it means extra work for the company to send out the reminder, they charge for it. A reminder fee.",
  "school_story_19_screen_11_button_1_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_19_screen_11_button_2_title": "Seems reasonable",
  "school_story_19_screen_11_button_3_title": "But why!",
  "school_story_19_screen_11_button_4_title": "Can they do that?",
  "school_story_19_screen_12_title": "Yes, that's how it is. Because you were liable for payment. Reminder fees are usually around 60pb.",
  "school_story_19_screen_12_subtitle": "The game you bought cost 200pb. How big is your debt now?",
  "school_story_19_screen_12_button_1_title": "Don't know",
  "school_story_19_screen_12_button_2_title": "60pb",
  "school_story_19_screen_12_button_3_title": "200pb",
  "school_story_19_screen_12_button_4_title": "260pb",
  "school_story_19_screen_13_title": "The correct answer is 260pb",
  "school_story_19_screen_13_subtitle": "What do you think will happen if you do not pay your debt now?",
  "school_story_19_screen_13_button_1_title": "Nothing...",
  "school_story_19_screen_13_button_2_title": "They get angry",
  "school_story_19_screen_13_button_3_title": "They send another reminder",
  "school_story_19_screen_13_button_4_title": "They forget my debt",

  "school_story_20_screen_12_button_4_title": "Woah...",
  "school_story_20_screen_13_title": "It's serious not to pay your debts. Like I said, it can cost you a lot and have long-term consequences.",

  "school_story_20_screen_13_button_1_title": "Huh, how can they do that?",
  "school_story_20_screen_13_button_2_title": "Yes, it's not yours if you did not pay",
  "school_story_20_screen_14_title": "Yes, it is so, if you have not paid, you do not own it. But let's summarize: If you do not pay on time, a debt of 200pb can increase to 1120pb.",
  "school_story_20_screen_14_subtitle": "And it can have consequences for several years, like a payment remark. So pay on time, it pays off!",
  "school_story_20_screen_14_button_1_title": "Yes, just sounds stupid not to",

  "school_story_21_screen_2_title": "Yes I also have dreams about expensive stuff. I would like to buy a small moon orbiting the planet 578, to build a holiday home on.",
  "school_story_21_screen_2_subtitle": "But it's a big expense, and I'll save for some time before I can afford it.",

  "school_story_21_screen_3_subtitle": "And loans for housing, for example, most people take at some point in their lives, because there are very few who have so much money that they have time to save up all the money for a home.",
  "school_story_21_screen_3_button_1_title": "I'd rather save",
  "school_story_21_screen_3_button_2_title": "That's good!",
  "school_story_21_screen_4_title": "If, for example, the refrigerator breaks and you do not have a buffer saved, you can not afford it, but without a refrigerator life is very difficult.",
  "school_story_21_screen_4_subtitle": "When you do not have the money to pay for the purchase directly, there are many companies that allow you to buy it in installments.",
  "school_story_21_screen_4_button_1_title": "I think I know what that is",
  "school_story_21_screen_4_button_2_title": "What is that?",
  "school_story_21_screen_5_title": "Buying in installments means that you do not pay the full amount at the same time. Instead, the company divides it into several smaller payments over a certain period of time.",
  "school_story_21_screen_5_subtitle": "It is often easier to pay a small amount each month when you receive a salary, because you need to keep money from the salary for regular costs as well.",
  "school_story_21_screen_5_button_1_title": "Yes, that sounds good",
  "school_story_21_screen_5_button_2_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_21_screen_6_title": "Let's try to count. If you wanted to buy something for 10.000pb in installments, and had 10 months to pay,",

  "school_story_21_screen_6_button_1_title": "500pb/ month",

  "school_story_21_screen_6_button_4_title": "1.500pb/ month",
  "school_story_21_screen_7_title": "If it didn't cost any extra, the correct answer would be: 1.000pb/month.",
  "school_story_21_screen_7_subtitle": "But when paying in installments, interest and other fees are often added, which makes it more expensive than paying directly. So you should try to have that savings buffer...",
  "school_story_21_screen_7_button_1_title": "Sounds expensive with installments",
  "school_story_21_screen_7_button_2_title": "Savings buffer I know is good",
  "school_story_21_screen_8_title": "In any case, in order to be allowed to buy in installments, or take a loan from the bank, the company would like to see if they think you will pay what you owe.",
  "school_story_21_screen_8_subtitle": "Both loans and installments are paid after you have received what you bought, in retrospect, and if they think you will not pay, companies or banks do not want to agree to it.",
  "school_story_21_screen_8_button_1_title": "Of course",
  "school_story_21_screen_8_button_2_title": "I get it...",
  "school_story_21_screen_8_button_3_title": "I can pay!",

  "school_story_21_screen_10_button_2_title": "I've heard of UC!",
  "school_story_21_screen_10_button_3_title": "Tell me more!",
  "school_story_21_screen_10_button_4_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_21_screen_11_title": "The credit referene contains information about your finances, almost like your personal finance history.",
  "school_story_21_screen_11_subtitle": "For example, it says how much you earn if you have a job. If you already have a loan, they are listed here and this is where payment remarks come in. ",
  "school_story_21_screen_11_button_1_title": "How do they fit in?",
  "school_story_21_screen_11_button_2_title": "Payment remark?",
  "school_story_21_screen_11_button_3_title": "I understand",
  "school_story_21_screen_11_button_4_title": "Right!",
  "school_story_21_screen_12_title": "Yes, this is where the payment remarks end up, on the credit references of companies like UC, who deal with this.",
  "school_story_21_screen_12_subtitle": "If you have had debts you have not paid, it is important information for other companies to know, and that is why a payment remark can affect whether you get a bank loan, for example.",
  "school_story_21_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ah, now it's clear",
  "school_story_21_screen_12_button_2_title": "Okidoki!",
  "school_story_21_screen_13_title": "In order for companies to easily understand whether you will be able to pay or not, a number is calculated for your finances.",
  "school_story_21_screen_13_subtitle": "The number is between 0 and 100, because it is a percentage.",
  "school_story_21_screen_13_button_1_title": "Interesting!",
  "school_story_21_screen_13_button_2_title": "A number is easy to understand!",
  "school_story_21_screen_14_title": "The estimated percentage of your finances is called the credit risk.",
  "school_story_21_screen_14_subtitle": "The credit risk describes how great the risk is that you will not pay a debt and receive a payment remark within 1 year.",
  "school_story_21_screen_14_button_1_title": "Okay...",
  "school_story_21_screen_15_title": "If you have a low credit risk, a low figure, it means that you handle your payments and that companies and banks do not have to be worried that you will not pay them.",
  "school_story_21_screen_15_subtitle": "But, if you have a high figure in the credit risk, they will not trust you to pay what you owe.",
  "school_story_21_screen_15_button_1_title": "I understand",

  "school_story_21_screen_15_button_3_title": "I understand, they do not want to risk it",
  "school_story_21_screen_15_button_4_title": "Trust me! I'll pay!",
  "school_story_21_screen_16_title": "A high number means, for example, that you already have a lot of loans or payment remarks in the past. But it could also be that you have too low of an income.",
  "school_story_21_screen_16_subtitle": "That is, you do not have a job or a job where you earn little money, and therefore probably can not afford to pay off the loan or debt.",
  "school_story_21_screen_16_button_1_title": "I do not have that!",
  "school_story_21_screen_16_button_2_title": "I never want that!",
  "school_story_21_screen_16_button_3_title": "I get it",
  "school_story_21_screen_16_button_4_title": "Not good",
  "school_story_21_screen_17_title": "The great thing about the credit reference is that it helps companies find out important information about customers' finances if they can afford to pay off a new debt or a new loan.",
  "school_story_21_screen_17_subtitle": "That means that people are not allowed to borrow more than they can afford, which is great because then they do not end up in major debts and problems!",

  "school_story_22_screen_5_button_2_title": "Interest",
  "school_story_22_screen_6_title": "Yes, it’s interest I'm talking about! The interest is paid out once a year.",
  "school_story_22_screen_6_subtitle": "The interest is generally quite low, often between 0 and 0.5%.",

  "school_story_22_screen_8_button_2_title": "I know how!",
  "school_story_22_screen_9_title": "If you can promise the bank that they can keep your money over a longer period of time, they will give you more interest.",
  "school_story_22_screen_9_subtitle": "I also mentioned this on planet 5, but if you don't remember, you can lock in your money. Meaning, you promise that you will not ask for the money until the time is up.",
  "school_story_22_screen_9_button_1_title": "I remember that",
  "school_story_22_screen_9_button_2_title": "Now that you mention it...",
