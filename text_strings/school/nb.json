  "school_story_3.4_screen_14_title": "Yes, sometimes you get more value, something better, if you buy a more expensive product.",
  "school_story_3.4_screen_14_subtitle": "Because if you know that the more expensive kiosk has better french fries and larger portions, then maybe you buy the more expensive ones, because it's worth it!",

  "school_story_3.4_screen_14_button_2_title": "I want the cheapest",

  "school_story_4.1_screen_2_subtitle": "Vet du hva å tjene er?",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_2_button_1_title": "Man får penger for å jobbe!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_2_button_2_title": "Å selge brukte ting!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_2_button_3_title": "Gjøre oppgaver og få betalt!",

  "school_story_4.1_screen_3_title": "Var det vanskelig å velge? Jeg lurte deg litt der, fordi alle svarene var rett nemlig.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_3_subtitle": "De er alle måter å tjene penger på!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_3_button_1_title": "Du lurte meg!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_4_title": "Ja, beklager. Men det er et godt poeng om du ser det? Det fins mange måter å tjene penger på. Du vet sikkert at man kan få andre ting enn penger.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_4_subtitle": "Du kan tjene penger, få berømmelse, en premie eller respekt! Men vi kommer bare til å snakke om å tjene penger.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_4_button_1_title": "Du har skaffet deg min respekt!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_4_button_2_title": "Jeg tror jeg fikk litt berømmelse!",

  "school_story_4.1_screen_4_button_4_title": "Jeg har lyst til å tjene penger!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_5_title": "Å tjene er å få noe i gjengjeld for jobben, arbeidsinnsatsen eller innsatsen du legger ned.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_5_subtitle": "Det er på grunn av det at alle eksemplene i starten var sanne.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_5_button_1_title": "Kan du minne meg på dem?",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_6_title": "Du får en lønn når du jobber. Dette er kanskje det mest klare eksempelet. Samme er det når man får penger for å utføre en oppgave.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_6_subtitle": "Oppgave er en veldig god måte å øve seg og lære at man faktisk må tjene penger. Man kan ikke bare få dem.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_6_button_1_title": "Ja, det er som en jobb for barn!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_8_title": "Når du får rente fra en sparekonto betyr det at du har gjort banken en tjeneste fordi du har lånt dem pengene dine. Og det er også en anstrengelse å spare!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_8_subtitle": "Den siste er kanskje den som er vanskeligst å forstå i starten. Det var alternativet 'å selge brukte ting’",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_8_button_1_title": "Ja, det er det, forklare takk",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_9_title": "I stedet for å kaste ting eller gi dem bort, kan du selge dem. Og det er anstrengelse og tid du har lagt i det, pluss at du tjener ekstra penger!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_9_subtitle": "Jeg tror du forstår hva å tjene penger er og kanskje til og med litt bedre nå. Og dette er en stor del av personlig økonomi!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_9_button_1_title": "Jeg tror jeg forstår det",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_9_button_2_title": "Kult, kjør på",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_10_title": "Tre viktige ting for å være god på håndtering av egne penger er: Tjene, spare og bruke. Tjene er en veldig sentral del.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_10_subtitle": "De henger alle sammen skjønner du. Så smart inntjening, sparing og bruk er en farlig god kombinasjon.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_10_button_1_title": "Syns jeg er smart når det kommer til forbruk",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_10_button_2_title": "Jeg er en utspekulert sparer!",

  "school_story_4.1_screen_11_title": "Å jobbe et sted og få lønn er den vanligste måten å tjene penger på.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_11_subtitle": "Uansett hva du gjør så er det bra å starte tidlig. Da tenker jeg på øvelse. Gjør øvelser, kanskje hjelpe naboer?",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_11_button_1_title": "Jeg vet allerede hvilken jobb jeg vil ha!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_11_button_2_title": "Jeg har ingen anelse hva jeg vil jobbe med",

  "school_story_4.1_screen_12_subtitle": "Ikke nå da, jeg så at noen hadde vunnet på i Lotto på denne planeten...",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_12_button_1_title": "Det hadde vært så fantastisk. Å vinne og bli millionær!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_13_title": "Det skjer, men om man skal være ærlig er det nok ikke noe du bør satse på... Ta skrapelodd for eksempel.",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_13_subtitle": "Visste du at sjansen for å vinne så mye penger er så lav at du kunne kjøpt en kupong hver dag for resten av livet ditt og ikke vinne en million?",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_13_button_1_title": "Hva? er det sant?",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_13_button_2_title": "Er du sikker..?",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_14_title": "Det er sant. Det kan bli regnet ut ved hjelp av mattematikk. Og om du hadde gjort det, for eksempel over 60 år, hadde du brukt litt over en halv million!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_14_subtitle": "Så jeg satser nok mer på å tjene. Flaks er fin, men god inntjening er sikkert og stabilt. Sparer du smart i stedet, med renter, vil du komme til å ha en million!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_14_button_1_title": "Det høres logisk ut! Og smart!",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_14_button_2_title": "Jeg må sjekke ut den mattematikken...",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_14_button_3_title": "Det høres helt utrolig ut",
  "school_story_4.1_screen_14_button_4_title": "Gambling er ikke bra!",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_1_title": "Nå vet du at lotteri eller å satse på flaks ikke er noen god strategi for å tjene penger.",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_1_subtitle": "Men hva er da..?",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "Hardt arbeid!",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_1_button_2_title": "Jeg vet ikke?",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_2_title": "Du må jo ha hørt at‘Penger vokser ikke på trær’?",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_2_button_1_title": "Ja, mange ganger",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_2_button_2_title": "Nei..?",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_3_title": "Det er en felles forståelse at du må jobbe for pengene.",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_3_subtitle": "Om du husker fra tidligere når det kommer til å spare og bruke penger, så må du tjene dem først!",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_3_button_1_title": "Ja, men hvordan..?",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_4_title": "Et eksempel på en jobb er å jobbe med å selge produkt eller lage dem.",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_4_subtitle": "Vet du hva det vil si å tilvirke et produkt?",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_4_button_1_title": "Å selge det",

  "school_story_4.2_screen_5_button_1_title": "Jaha. Ok!",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_5_button_2_title": "Ja, visste det",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_7_title": "Alt kan være en jobb hvis du kan tjene penger på det. Kanskje du allerede har en idé til en oppfinnelse du kan selge?",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_7_button_1_title": "Jeg skal tenke på det",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_7_button_2_title": "Jeg vet det allerede. Jeg er sikker på det!",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_8_title": "Du har faktisk lov til å skaffe deg en jobb fra 13 års alder. Vanligvis under sommeren.",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_8_button_1_title": "Det høres interessant ut..",

  "school_story_4.2_screen_10_subtitle": "Så jeg fikk bare 15 pb i timen. Og det var litt for lite i forhold til lovene.",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_10_button_1_title": "Ja, det høres ut som gode ting å vite",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_10_button_2_title": "Jeg kan reglene allered faktisk!",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_11_title": "Selv om det er noen år til du er 13 år kan du gjøre enkle oppgaver i huset hjemme for å tjene penger.",

  "school_story_4.2_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ja, jeg vil vite det.",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_12_button_2_title": "Nå..?",
  "school_story_4.2_screen_13_title": "Jeg skal fortelle deg det etter du har gjort utfordringen!",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_1_title": "Klar for å lære noen gode tips til hvordan man skal tjene penger som barn?",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_1_button_1_title": "Er jeg!?",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_1_button_2_title": "Jeg ble født klar!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_2_title": "Tips nummer 1 er om å jobbe fordi det er den mest klassiske måten å tjene penger på. ‘Men hei Sparegris’, sier kanskje du. Jeg er gammel nok til å skaffe meg en jobb.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_2_subtitle": "Det betyr ikke dermed at du kan jobbe og tjene penger! Fordi at om du gjør oppgaver og får betalt betyr det at du tjener penger!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_2_button_1_title": " Da tjener jeg allerede!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_2_button_2_title": "Kan jeg begynne å tjene på den måten?",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_3_title": " Ja! Så det første tipset er å sette opp noen oppgaver og kanskje se på hva foreldrene dine trenger hjelp med. Da kan du starte inntjeningen!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_3_subtitle": "Om du vil kan du gjøre oppgaver hver uke for å ha en stabil inntekt, eller så kan du gjøre ulike ting ulike uker. Det er opp til deg og foreldrene dine.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_3_button_1_title": "Jeg kommer til å bli rik!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_3_button_2_title": "Gjør oppgaver allerede. Hvordan kan jeg tjene mer?",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_4_title": "Ok. så tips nr. 2 er å prøve å finne mer ting som du kan hjelpe til med utenfor hjemmet. Du kan jo for eksempel sjekke med besteforeldrene dine.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_4_subtitle": "Du kan spørre naboene dine om du kan hjelpe dem mot betaling? Men spør foreldrene dine først om de synes det er greit.",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_5_subtitle": "Du kan arrangere et loppemarked!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_5_button_1_title": "Hva skulle jeg selge?",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_5_button_2_title": "Hvor kunne jeg gjort det?",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_5_button_3_title": "Hvordan?",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_5_button_4_title": "Jeg har gjort det!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_6_title": "Gå gjennom sakene dine og ta saker som du ikke bruker noe mer. Å selge brukte ting er også bra for miljøet!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_6_subtitle": "Men sjekk alltid med foreldrene dine. Og når du likavel spør dem kan du sjekke om de har noe de vil donere til hagesalget ditt!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_6_button_1_title": "Jeg vet om noen ting jeg kan selge",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_6_button_2_title": "Jeg hører. Kjør på..",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_7_title": "Nå når du har noe å selge kan du selge dem på loppemarked eller på nettet!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_7_subtitle": "Det fins mange loppemarkeder der du kan leie en plass til å selge tingene, og ofte fins det loppemarked for barn, bare for barn akkurat som deg selv!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_7_button_1_title": "Det høres morsomt ut!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_7_button_2_title": "Jeg er litt for sjenert til det",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_7_button_3_title": "Jeg er for lat til det...",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_7_button_4_title": "Kanskje. Jeg skal tenke på det",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_9_title": "Jeg vil ikke gnage på deg, men når man selger ting (eller tjener, bruker eller sparer), bør man sjekke med foreldrene sine.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_9_subtitle": "Før du virkelig har finansielle superkrefter og blir litt eldre, er det viktig å be om tillatelse og lov av foreldrene.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_9_button_1_title": "Ja, det er sant...",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_9_button_2_title": "Ok, jeg skal det",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_10_title": "Mitt siste tips akkurat nå: er at tjene ved å bruke.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_10_subtitle": "Og det er jo et sparetips egentlig, men om du legger inn innsats kan det bli inntjening også!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_10_button_1_title": "Høres rart ut fortsatt...",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_10_button_2_title": "Jeg forstår det!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_11_title": "Så det handler om å tenke hardt, planlegge og sammenligne priser før du kjøper noe. Og kanskje til og med vente til det er salg.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_11_subtitle": "La oss si at du har et sparemål du setter deg opp. Du sparer til å kjøpe en...",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_11_button_3_title": "Spillkonsoll!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_11_button_4_title": "Ingen av dem!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_12_title": "Haha, la oss si at du sparer til noe enklere. Trådløse hodetelfoner for eksempel. Mens du venter på at du skal ha nok oppsparte penger,",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_12_subtitle": "Du kan begynne med å sammenligne priser i ulike butikker. Når du vet hvilke hodetelefoner du vil ha, kan du sjekke hvilken butikk som har den beste prisen.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_12_button_1_title": "Det høres veldig smart ut",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_title": "Det er veldig smart. Noen ganger kan det spare deg for flere hundre kroner! Og om du er tolmodig og ekstra utspekulert kan vil du planlegge til det er salg...",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_subtitle": "Planlegg å kjøpe dem når det er store salg, som black friday i november, eller julesalg.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "Å nei, jeg liker ikke å vente",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_2_title": "Høres tøft ut!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_3_title": "Det er veldig smart!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_4_title": "Jeg gjør alltid det!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_title": "Det kan vere tøft å gjøre, men du kan spare veldig mye!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_subtitle": "Vi later som om hodetelefoner koster 1000 kr. På et salg så kan du kanskje kjøpe dem for 700 kr og da har du 300 kr igjen! Da har du råd til film på kino + masse snacks!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_button_1_title": "Jeg skal prøve på det!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_button_2_title": "Kanskje jeg forsøker...",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_button_3_title": "Tenkte ikke på det på den måten!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_button_4_title": "Det er ganske mye!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_15_title": "Og fordi det krevde innsats kan du faktisk si at du tjente dem, selv om du da sier du har reddet dem.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_15_subtitle": "Jeg lar deg tenke litt på dette. Du har forhåpentligvis en hel masse ting å prøve ut for å forsøke å tjene penger nå!",
