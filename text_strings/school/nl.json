  "school_story_4.3_screen_3_button_2_title": "I already do chores, how can I earn more?",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_4_title": "Okay so tip nr. 2 is to try and find more things to help out with outside your home. You could check with grandparents for example.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_4_subtitle": "And you can ask neighbours if you could help them for payment, but ask your parents first if they think it's okay!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_4_button_1_title": "Sounds like a good idea!",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_10_button_2_title": "I get it!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_11_title": "So it's about planning and comparing prices before you buy something. And maybe even waiting for a sale.",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_11_button_4_title": "None of those!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_12_title": "Haha, let's say you save for something simpler, like wireless headphones. While you are saving and waiting to have enough money...",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_12_subtitle": "...you can start comparing prices in different stores. When you know what pair of headphones you want, you can check what store that has the best price.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_12_button_1_title": "That sounds very smart",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_title": "It is! Sometimes that could save you a lot of money! And if you are patient and extra nifty, you will plan for a sale...",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_subtitle": "Either plan to buy the headphones during big sales, like Black Friday in November, or the Christmas sales.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "Oh no I don't like waiting",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_2_title": "Sounds hard!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_3_title": "This is really smart!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_4_title": "I always do that!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_title": "This can be hard. But if you find a sale that is really good, you can save a lot!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_subtitle": "If the headphones cost 1000pb normally, if you wait for a sale, maybe you can buy them for 700pb. Then you save 300pb! That's like, a visit in the movie theatre + snacks!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_button_1_title": "I will try it!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_button_2_title": "Maybe I'll try...",
